    <p>

      one would have called Rose Arundel handsome, or even pretty, and yet her
      face had a charm about it&mdash;a charm that lurked in the depths of her
      dreamy grey eyes, and played about the corners of her mouth when she
      smiled, and sat like a glory upon her high, smooth forehead. Both she and
      her mother were clad in the deepest mourning, and the traces of some
      recent heartfelt sorrow might be discerned in either face. A stranger
      would have taken them for sisters, rather than for mother and daughter;
      for there were lines of thought on Rose&rsquo;s brow which her twenty years
      scarcely warranted, while Mrs. Arundel, at eight-and-thirty, looked full
      six years younger, despite her widow&rsquo;s cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking, Rose,&rdquo; resumed the elder lady, after a short pause,
      during which she continued pacing the room most assiduously, &ldquo;I have been
      thinking that if we were to settle near some large town, I could give
      lessons in music and singing: my voice is as good as ever it was&mdash;listen;&rdquo;
       and, seating herself at a small cottage piano, she began to execute some
      difficult solfeggi in a rich, clear soprano, with a degree of ease and
      grace which proved her to be a finished singer; and, apparently carried
      away by the feeling the music had excited, she allowed her voice to flow,
      as it were unconsciously, into the words of an Italian song, which she
      continued for some moments, without noticing a look of pain which shot
      across her daughter&rsquo;s pale features. At length, suddenly breaking off, she
      exclaimed in a voice broken with emotion, &ldquo;Ah! what am I singing?&rdquo; and,
      burying her face in her handkerchief, she burst into a flood of tears: it
      had been her husband&rsquo;s favourite song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering herself more quickly than from the violence of her grief might
      have been expected, she was about to resume her walk, when, observing for
      the first time the expression of her daughter&rsquo;s face, she sprang towards
      her, and placing her arm caressingly round her waist, kissed her tenderly,
      exclaiming in a tone of the fondest affection, &ldquo;Rose, my own darling, I
      have distressed you by my heedlessness, but I forget everything now!&rdquo; She
      paused; then added, in a calmer tone, &ldquo;Really, love, I have been thinking
      seriously of what I said just now about teaching. If I could but get a
      sufficient number of pupils, it would be much better than allowing you to
      go out as governess, for we could live together then; and I know I shall
      never be able to part with you. Besides, you would be miserable, managing
      naughty children all day long&mdash;throwing away your talents on a set of
      stupid little wretches,&mdash;such drudgery would <i>ennui</i> you to
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think, mamma, that I could be content to live in idleness and
      allow you to work for my support?&rdquo; replied Rose, while a faint smile
      played over her expressive features. &ldquo;Oh, no! Lewis will try to obtain
      some appointment: you shall live with him and keep his house, while I go
      out as governess for a few years; and we must save all we can, until we
      are rich enough to live together again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps some day we may be able to come back and take the dear old
      cottage, if Lewis is very lucky and should make a fortune,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
      Arundel. &ldquo;How shall we be able to bear to leave it!&rdquo; she added, glancing
      round the room regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, indeed!&rdquo; replied Rose, with a sigh; &ldquo;but it must be done. Lewis will
      not feel it as we shall&mdash;he has been away so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems an age,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Arundel, musing. &ldquo;How old was he when he
      left Westminster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen, was he not?&rdquo; replied Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has been at Bonn three years. Why, Rose, he must be a man by this
      time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Frere wrote us word he was the taller of the two by half a head last
      year, if you recollect,&rdquo; returned Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Arundel, starting up and going to the window, which
      opened in the French fashion upon a small flower-garden. As she spoke, the
      gate-bell rang smartly, and in another moment the person outside, having
      apparently caught sight of the figure at the window, sprang lightly over
      the paling, crossed the lawn in a couple of bounds, and ere the slave of
      the bell had answered its impatient summons, Lewis was in his mother&rsquo;s
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first greeting, in which smiles and tears had mingled in strange
      fellowship, Mrs. Arundel drew her son towards a table, on which a lamp was
      burning, saying as she did so, &ldquo;Why, Rose, can this be our little Lewis?
      He is as tall as a grenadier! Heads up, sir!&mdash;Attention!&mdash;You
      are going to be inspected. Do you remember when the old sergeant used to
      drill us all, and wanted to teach Rose to fence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smiling at his mother&rsquo;s caprice, Lewis Arundel drew himself up to his full
      height, and, placing his back against the wall, stood in the attitude of a
      soldier on parade&mdash;his head just touching the frame of a picture
      which hung above him. The light of the lamp shone full upon the spot where
      he had stationed himself, displaying a face and figure on which a mother&rsquo;s
      eye might well rest with pride and admiration. Considerably above the
      middle height, his figure was slender, but singularly graceful; his head
      small and intellectual looking. The features, exquisitely formed, were, if
      anything, too delicately cut and regular; which, together with a brilliant
      complexion and long silken eyelashes, tended to impart an almost feminine
      character to his beauty. The expression of his face, however, effectually
      counteracted any such tendency; no one could observe the flashing of the
      dark eyes, the sarcastic curl of the short upper lip, the curved nostril
      slightly drawn back, the stern resolution of the knitted brow, without
      tracing signs of pride unbroken, stormy feelings and passions unsubdued,
      and an iron will, which, according as it might be directed, must prove
      all-powerful for good or evil. His hair, which he wore somewhat long, was,
      like his mother&rsquo;s, of that jet black colour characteristic of the
      inhabitants of a southern clime rather than of the descendants of the
      fair-haired Saxons, while a soft down of the same dark hue as his
      clustering curls fringed the sides of his face, affording promise of a
      goodly crop of whiskers. Despite the differences of feature and
      expression,&mdash;and they were great,&mdash;there was a decided
      resemblance between the brother and sister, and the same indescribable
      charm, which made it next to impossible to watch Rose Arundel without
      loving her, shed its sunshine also over Lewis&rsquo;s face when he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      After surveying her son attentively, with eyes which sparkled with
      surprise and pleasure, Mrs. Arundel exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, how the boy is
      altered! Is he not improved, Rose?&rdquo; As she spoke, she involuntarily
      glanced from Lewis to the picture under which he stood. It was a
      half-length portrait of a young man, in what appeared to be some foreign
      uniform, the hand resting on the hilt of a cavalry sabre. The features,
      though scarcely so handsome, were strikingly like those of Lewis Arundel,
      the greatest difference being in the expression, which was more joyous,
      and that the hair in the portrait was of a rich brown instead of black.
      After comparing the two for a moment, Mrs Arundel attempted to speak, but
      her voice failing from emotion, she burst into tears, and hastily left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Rose, what is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis in surprise; &ldquo;is my mother ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is your likeness to that picture, Lewis love, that has overcome
      her: you know it is a portrait of our dearest father&rdquo; (her voice faltered
      as she pronounced his name), &ldquo;taken just after they were married, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis regarded the picture attentively, then averting his head as if he
      could not bear that even Rose should witness his grief, he threw himself
      on a sofa and concealed his face with his hands. Recovering himself almost
      immediately, he drew his sister gently towards him, and placing her beside
      him, asked, as he stroked her glossy hair&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, dearest, how is it that I was not informed of our poor father&rsquo;s
      illness? Surely a letter must have miscarried!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not mamma explain to you, then, how sudden it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word: she only wrote a few hurried lines, leading me to prepare for
      a great shock; then told me that my father was dead; and entreating me to
      return immediately, broke off abruptly, saying she could write no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor mamma! she was quite overcome by her grief, and yet she was so
      excited and so anxious to save me, she <i>would</i> do everything herself.
      I wished her to let me write to you, but she objected, and I was afraid of
      annoying her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was most unfortunate,&rdquo; returned Lewis; &ldquo;in her hurry she misdirected
      the letter; and, as I told you when I wrote, I was from home at the time,
      and did not receive it till three weeks after it should have reached me. I
      was at a rifle-match got up by some of the students, and had just gained
      the prize, a pair of silver-mounted pistols, when her letter was put into
      my hand. Fancy receiving such news in a scene of gaiety!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How exquisitely painful! My poor brother!&rdquo; said Rose, while the tears she
      could no longer repress dimmed her bright eyes. After a moment she
      continued, &ldquo;But I was going to tell you,&mdash;it was more than a month
      ago,&mdash;poor papa had walked over to Warlington to negotiate about
      selling one of his paintings. Did you know that he had lately made his
      talent for painting serve as a means of adding to our income?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Frere told me of it last year,&rdquo; replied Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, Mr. Frere was kind enough to get introductions to several
      picture-dealers, and was of the greatest use,&rdquo; continued Rose. &ldquo;Well, when
      papa came in, he looked tired and harassed; and in answer to my questions,
      he said he had received intelligence which had excited him a good deal,
      and added something about being called upon to take a very important step.
      I left him to fetch a glass of wine, and when I returned, to my horror,
      his head was leaning forward on his breast, and he was both speechless and
      insensible. We instantly sent for the nearest medical man, but it was of
      no use; he pronounced it to be congestion of the brain, and gave us no
      hope: his opinion was but too correct; my dear father never spoke again,
      and in less than six hours all was over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; murmured Lewis. &ldquo;My poor Rose, how shocked you must have
      been!&rdquo; After a few minutes&rsquo; silence he continued, &ldquo;And what was this news
      which produced such an effect upon my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange to say,&rdquo; replied Rose, &ldquo;we have not the slightest notion. No
      letter or other paper has been found which could at all account for it,
      nor can we learn that papa met any one at Warlington likely to have
      brought him news. The only clue we have been able to gain is that Mr.
      Bowing, who keeps the library there, remarked that papa came in as usual
      to look at the daily papers, and as he was reading, suddenly uttered an
      exclamation of surprise and put his hand to his brow. Mr. Bowing was about
      to inquire whether anything was the matter, when he was called away to
      attend to a customer; and when he was again at liberty papa had left the
      shop. Mr. Bowing sent us the paper afterwards, but neither mamma nor I
      could discover in it anything we could imagine at all likely to have
      affected papa so strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How singular!&rdquo; returned Lewis, musing. &ldquo;What could it possibly have been?
      You say my father&rsquo;s papers have been examined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mamma wrote to Mr. Coke, papa&rsquo;s man of business in London, and he
      came down directly, but nothing appeared to throw any light on the matter.
      Papa had not even made a will.&rdquo; She paused to dry the tears which had
      flowed copiously during this narration, then continued: &ldquo;But oh! Lewis, do
      you know we are so very, very poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected as much, dear Rose; I knew my father&rsquo;s was a life income. But
      why speak in such a melancholy tone? Surely my sister has not grown
      mercenary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely that, I hope,&rdquo; returned Rose, smiling; &ldquo;but there is some
      difference between being mercenary and regretting that we are so poor that
      we shall be unable to live together: is there not, Lewis dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unable to live together?&rdquo; repeated Lewis slowly. &ldquo;Yes, well, I may of
      course be obliged to leave you, but I shall not accept any employment
      which will necessitate my quitting England, so I shall often come and take
      a peep at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but, Lewis love, it is worse than that&mdash;we shall not be able to&mdash;&mdash;
      Hush! here comes mamma; we will talk about this another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Lewis,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Arundel, entering the room with a light
      elastic step, without a trace of her late emotion visible on her animated
      countenance, &ldquo;what is this? Here&rsquo;s Rachel complaining that you have
      brought a wild beast with you, which has eaten up all the tea-cakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let alone fright&rsquo;ning the blessed cat so that she&rsquo;s flowed up the chimley
      like a whirlpool, and me a&rsquo;most in fits all the time, the brute! But I&rsquo;ll
      not sleep in the house with it, to be devoured like a cannibal in my quiet
      bed, if there was not another sitivation in Sussex!&rdquo; And here Rachel, a
      stout serving-woman, with a face which, sufficiently red by nature, had
      become the deepest crimson from fear and anger, burst into a flood of
      tears, which, mingling with a tolerably thick deposit of soot, acquired
      during the hurried rise and progress of the outraged cat, imparted to her
      the appearance of some piebald variety of female Ethiopian Serenader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rachel, have you forgotten me?&rdquo; inquired Lewis, as soon as he could speak
      for laughing. &ldquo;What are you crying about? You are not so silly as to be
      afraid of a dog? Here, Faust, where are you?&rdquo; As he spoke he uttered a
      low, peculiar whistle; and in obedience to his signal a magnificent
      Livonian wolf-hound, which bore sufficient likeness to the animal it was
      trained to destroy to have alarmed a more discriminating zoologist than
      poor Rachel, sprang into the room, and, delighted at rejoining his master,
      began to testify his joy so roughly as not only to raise the terror of
      that damsel to screaming point, but to cause Mrs. Arundel to interpose a
      chair between herself and the intruder, while Rose, pale but silent,
      shrank timidly into a corner of the apartment. In an instant the
      expression of Lewis&rsquo;s face changed; his brow contracted, his mouth grew
      stern, and fixing his flashing eyes upon those of the dog, he uttered in a
      deep, low voice some German word of command; and as he spoke the animal
      dropped at his feet, where it crouched in a suppliant attitude, gazing
      wistfully at his master&rsquo;s countenance, without offering to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not have erected a barricade to defend yourself, my dear
      mother,&rdquo; said Lewis, as a smile chased the cloud which had for a moment
      shaded his features; &ldquo;the monster is soon quelled. Rose, you must learn to
      love Faust&mdash;he is my second self; come and stroke him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, Rose approached and patted the dog&rsquo;s shaggy head, at first
      timidly, but more boldly when she found that he still retained his
      crouching posture, merely repaying her caresses by fixing his bright,
      truthful eyes upon her face lovingly, and licking his lips with his long
      red tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Rachel,&rdquo; continued Lewis, &ldquo;it is your turn; come, I must have you
      good friends with Faust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t do it, indeed&mdash;no
      disrespect to you, Mr. Lewis, though you have growed a man in foreign
      parts. I may be a servant of all work, but I didn&rsquo;t engage myself to look
      after wild beasts, sir. No! nor wouldn&rsquo;t, if you was to double my wages,
      and put the washin&rsquo; out&mdash;I can&rsquo;t abear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish girl! it&rsquo;s the most good-natured dog in the world. Here, he&rsquo;ll
      give you his paw; come and shake hands with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it, sir; I&rsquo;m jest a-going to set the tea-things. I won&rsquo;t,
      then, that&rsquo;s flat,&rdquo; exclaimed Rachel, waxing rebellious in the extremity
      of her terror, and backing rapidly towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo; returned Lewis quietly; &ldquo;every one does as I bid them.&rdquo;
       And grasping her wrist, while he fixed his piercing glance sternly upon
      her, he led her up to the dog, and in spite of a faint show of resistance,
      a half-frightened, half-indignant &ldquo;I dare say, indeed,&rdquo; and a muttered
      hint of her conviction &ldquo;that he had lately been accustomed to drive black
      nigger slaves in Guinea,&rdquo; with an intimation &ldquo;that he&rsquo;d find white flesh
      and blood wouldn&rsquo;t stand it, and didn&rsquo;t ought to, neither,&rdquo; succeeded in
      making her shake its great paw, and finally (as she perceived no symptoms
      of the <i>humanivorous</i> propensities with which her imagination had
      endowed it), pat its shaggy sides. &ldquo;There, now you&rsquo;ve made up your
      quarrel, Faust shall help you to carry my things upstairs,&rdquo; said Lewis;
      and slinging a small travelling valise round the dog&rsquo;s neck, he again
      addressed him in German, when the well-trained animal left the room with
      the astonished but no longer refractory Rachel.

    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be a conjurer, Lewis,&rdquo; exclaimed his mother, who had remained a
      silent but amused spectator of the foregoing scene. &ldquo;Why, Rachel manages
      the whole house. Rose and I do exactly what she tells us, don&rsquo;t we, Rose?
      What did you do to her? was it mesmerism?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made use of one of the secrets of the mesmerist, certainly,&rdquo; replied
      Lewis; &ldquo;I managed her by the power of a strong will over a weak one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hardly call Rachel&rsquo;s a weak will,&rdquo; observed Rose, with a quiet
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must confess, at all events, mine is a stronger,&rdquo; replied Lewis.
      &ldquo;When I consider it necessary to carry a point, I usually find some way of
      doing it; it was necessary for the sake of Faust&rsquo;s well-being to manage
      Rachel, and I did so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke carelessly, but there was something in his bearing and manner
      which told of conscious power and inflexible resolution, and you felt
      instinctively that you were in the presence of a masterspirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea made its appearance; Rachel, upon whom the charm still appeared to
      operate, seeming in the highest possible good humour,&mdash;a frame of
      mind most unusual with that exemplary woman, who belonged to that trying
      class of servants who, on the strength of their high moral character and
      intense respectability, see fit to constitute themselves a kind of
      domestic scourges, household horse-hair shirts (if we may be allowed the
      expression), and, bent on fulfilling their mission to the <i>enth</i>,
      keep their martyred masters and mistresses in a constant state of mental
      soreness and irritation from morning till night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea came,&mdash;the cakes demolished by the reprobate Faust in the
      agitation of his arrival (he was far too well-bred a dog to have done such
      a thing had he had time for reflection) having been replaced by some
      marvellous impromptu resulting from Rachel&rsquo;s unhoped-for state of mind.
      The candles burned brightly; the fire (for though it was the end of May, a
      fire was still an agreeable companion) blazed and sparkled cheerily, but
      yet a gloom hung over the little party. One feeling was uppermost in each
      mind, and saddened every heart. He whom they had loved with a deep and
      tender affection, such as but few of us are so fortunate as to call forth,
      the kind and indulgent husband and father, the dear <i>friend</i> rather
      than the master of that little household, had been taken from amongst
      them; and each word, each look, each thought of the past, each hope for
      the future, served to realise in its fullest bitterness the heavy loss
      they had sustained. Happy are the dead whose virtues are chronicled, not
      on sculptured stone, but in the faithful hearts of those whom they have
      loved on earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening, in the course of conversation, Mrs. Arundel again
      referred to the project of teaching music and singing. Lewis made no
      remark on the matter at the time, though his sister fancied, from his
      compressed lip and darkened brow, that it had not passed him unobserved.
      When the two ladies were about to retire for the night, Lewis signed to
      his sister to remain; and having lighted his mother&rsquo;s candle, kissed her
      affectionately, and wished her good-night, he closed the door. There was a
      moment&rsquo;s silence, which was broken by Lewis saying abruptly, &ldquo;Rose, what
      did my mother mean about giving singing lessons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, unselfish mamma!&rdquo; replied Rose, &ldquo;always ready to sacrifice her own
      comfort for those she loves! She wants, when we leave the cottage, to
      settle near some large town, that she may be able to teach music and
      singing (you know what a charming voice she has), in order to save me from
      the necessity of going out as governess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the cottage! go out as governess!&rdquo; repeated Lewis in a low voice,
      as if he scarcely understood the purport of her words. &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, love, we are too poor to continue living here, or indeed
      anywhere, in idleness; we must, at all events for a few years, work for
      our living; and you cannot suppose I would let mamma&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis sternly, &ldquo;you will distract me.&rdquo; He paused for
      some minutes in deep thought; then asked, in a cold, hard tone of voice,
      which, to one skilled in reading the human heart, told of intense feelings
      and stormy passions kept down by the power of an iron will, &ldquo;Tell me, what
      is the amount of the pittance that stands between us and beggary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lewis, do not speak so bitterly; we have still each other&rsquo;s love
      remaining, and Heaven to look forward to; and with such blessings, even
      poverty need not render us unhappy.&rdquo; And as she uttered these words, Rose
      leaned fondly upon her brother&rsquo;s shoulder, and gazed up into his face with
      a look of such deep affection, such pure and holy confidence, that even
      his proud spirit, cruelly as it had been wounded by the unexpected shock,
      could not withstand it. Placing his arm round her, he drew her towards
      him, and kissing her high, pale brow, murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, dear Rose; I have grown harsh and stern of late&mdash;all are
      not true and good as you are. Believe me, it was for your sake and my
      mother&rsquo;s that I felt this blow: for myself, I heed it not, save as it
      impedes freedom of action. And now answer my question, What have we left
      to live upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About £100 a year was what Mr. Coke told mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, on an average, what does it cost living in this cottage as
      comfortably as you have been accustomed to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor papa used to reckon we spent £200 a year here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more, you are certain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Lewis paused in deep thought, his brow resting on his hand. At
      length he said, suddenly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it no doubt can be done, and shall. Now, Rose, listen to me. While I
      live and can work, neither my mother nor you shall do anything for your
      own support, or leave the rank you have held in society. You shall retain
      this cottage, and live as you have been accustomed to do, and as befits
      the widow and daughter of him that is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Lewis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, you do not know me. When I left England I was a boy: in years,
      perhaps, I am little else even yet; but circumstances have made me older
      than my years, and in mind and disposition I am a man, and a determined
      one. I feel strongly and deeply in regard to the position held by my
      mother and sister, and therefore on this point it is useless to oppose
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose looked steadily in his face, and saw that what he said was true;
      therefore, exercising an unusual degree of common sense for a woman, she
      held her tongue, and let a wilful man have his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, would you know the circumstances which had changed Lewis Arundel
      from a boy to a man? They are soon told. He had loved, foolishly perhaps,
      but with all the pure and ardent passion, the fond and trusting confidence
      of youth&mdash;he had loved, and been deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis had walked some miles that day, and had travelled both by sea and
      land; it may therefore reasonably be supposed that he was tolerably
      sleepy. Nevertheless, before he went to bed he sat down and wrote the
      following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Frere,&mdash;There were but two men in the world of whom I would
      have asked a favour, or from whom I would accept assistance&mdash;my poor
      father was one, you are the other. A week since I received a letter to
      tell me of my father&rsquo;s death: to-day I have returned to England to learn
      that I am a beggar. Had I no tie to bind me, no one but myself to
      consider, I should instantly quit a country in which poverty is a deadly
      sin. In Germany or Italy I could easily render myself independent, either
      as painter or musician; and the careless freedom of the artist life suits
      me well; but the little that remains from my father&rsquo;s scanty fortune is
      insufficient to support my mother and sister. Therefore I apply to you,
      and if you can help me, you may&mdash;your willingness to do so, I <i>know</i>.
      I must obtain, immediately, some situation or employment which will bring
      me in £200 a year; though, if my purchaser (for I consider that I am
      selling myself) will lodge and feed me, as he does his horse or his dog,
      £50 less would do. I care not what use I am put to, so that no moral
      degradation is attached to it. You know what I am fit for, as well
      01-better than I do myself. I have not forgotten the Greek and Latin
      flogged into us at Westminster, and have added thereto French, Italian,
      and, of course, German; besides picking up sundry small accomplishments,
      which may induce somebody to offer a higher price for me; and as the more
      I get, the sooner I shall stand a chance of becoming my own master again,
      I feel intensely mercenary. Write as soon as possible, for, in my present
      frame of mind, inaction will destroy me. I long to see you again, old
      fellow. I have not forgotten the merry fortnight we spent together last
      year, when I introduced you to student-life in the &lsquo;Vaterland&rsquo;; nor the
      good advice you gave me, which if I had acted on&mdash;&mdash; Well,
      regrets are useless, if not worse. Of course I shall have to come up to
      town, in which case we can talk; so, as I hate writing, and am as tired as
      a dog, I may as well wind up. Good-bye till we meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate Friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lewis Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Talking of dogs, you don&rsquo;t know Faust&mdash;I picked him up
      after you came away last year; but wherever I go, or whoever takes me,
      Faust must go also. He is as large as a calf, which is inconvenient, and I
      doubt whether he is full-grown yet. I dare say you think this childish,
      and very likely you are right, but I <i>must</i> have my dog. I can&rsquo;t live
      among strangers without something to love, and that loves me; so don&rsquo;t
      worry me about it, there&rsquo;s a good fellow. Can&rsquo;t you write to me
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having in some measure relieved his mind by finishing this letter, Lewis
      undressed, and sleep soon effaced the lines which bitter thoughts and an
      aching heart had stamped upon his fair young brow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;SHOWING HOW LEWIS LOSES HIS TEMPER, AND LEAVES HIS HOME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;H</span>as the post come
      in yet, Rose?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Arundel, as she made her appearance in the
      breakfast-room the following morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mamma; it is late to-day, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always late when I particularly expect a letter; that old creature
      Richards the postman has a spite against me, I am certain, because I once
      said in his hearing that he looked like an owl&mdash;the imbecile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma! he&rsquo;s a charming old man, with his venerable white hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, my dear, but he&rsquo;s extremely like an owl, nevertheless,&rdquo;
       replied Mrs. Arundel, cutting bread and butter with the quickness and
      regularity of a steam-engine as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the letters, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; exclaimed Rachel, entering with a polished
      face beaming out of a marvellous morning cap, composed of a species of
      opaque muslin (or some analogous female fabric), which appeared to be
      labouring under a violent eruption of little thick dots, strongly
      suggestive of small-pox. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the letters, ma&rsquo;am. If you please, I
      can&rsquo;t get Mr. Lewis out of bed nohow, though I&rsquo;ve knocked at his door
      three times this here blessed morning; and the last time he made a noise
      at me in French, or some other wicked foreigneering lingo; which is what I
      won&rsquo;t put up with&mdash;no! not if you was to go down upon your bended
      knees to me without a hassock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the letters, Rachel,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arundel eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters, indeed!&rdquo; was the reply, as, with an indignant toss of the head,
      Rachel, whose temper appeared to have been soaked in vinegar during the
      night, flung the wished-for missives upon the table. &ldquo;Letters, indeed!
      them&rsquo;s all as you care about, and not a poor gal as slaves and slaves, and
      gets insulted for her trouble; but I&rsquo;m come to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re come to bring the toast just at the right moment,&rdquo; said Lewis, who
      had approached unobserved, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re going down to give Faust his
      breakfast; and he is quite ready for it, too, poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a marvellous change seemed to come over the temper and
      countenance of Rachel: her ideas, as she turned to leave the room, may be
      gathered from the following soliloquy, which appeared to escape her
      unawares:&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as &rsquo;andsome as a duke, let alone his blessed
      father; but them was shocking words for a Christian with a four years&rsquo;
      carikter to put up with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During Rachel&rsquo;s little attempt at an <i>émeute</i>, which the appearance
      of Lewis had so immediately quelled, Mrs. Arundel had been eagerly
      perusing a letter, which she now handed to Rose, saying, with an air of
      triumph, &ldquo;Read that, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news, I hope, my dear mother, from your manner?&rdquo; observed Lewis,
      interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent news,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Arundel gaily. &ldquo;Show your brother the
      letter, Rose. Oh! that good, kind Lady Lombard!&rdquo; Rose did as she was
      desired, but from the anxiety with which she scanned her brother&rsquo;s
      countenance, as he hastily ran his eye over the writing, it was evident
      she doubted whether the effect the letter might produce upon him would be
      altogether of an agreeable nature. Nor was her suspicion unfounded, for as
      he became acquainted with its contents a storm-cloud gathered upon Lewis&rsquo;s
      brow. The letter was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Arundel,&mdash;To assist the afflicted, and to relieve the
      unfortunate, as well by the influence of the rank and station which have
      been graciously entrusted to me, as by the judicious employment of such
      pecuniary superfluity as the munificence of my poor dear late husband has
      placed me in a position to disburse, has always been my motto through
      life. The many calls of the numerous dependents on the liberality of the
      late lamented Sir Pinchbeck, with constant applications from the relatives
      of his poor dear predecessor (the Girkins are a very large family, and
      some of the younger branches have turned out shocking pickles), reduce the
      charitable fund at my disposal to a smaller sum than, from the noble
      character of my last lamented husband&rsquo;s will, may generally be supposed. I
      am, therefore, all the more happy to be able to inform you that, owing to
      the too high estimation in which my kind neighbours in and about
      Comfortown hold any recommendation of mine, I can, should you determine on
      settling near our pretty little town, promise you six pupils to begin
      with, and a prospect of many more should youi method of imparting
      instruction in the delightful science of music realise the very high
      expectations raised by my eulogium on your talents, vocal and
      instrumental. That such will be the case I cannot doubt, from my
      recollection of the touching manner in which, when we visited your sweet
      little cottage on our (alas! too happy) wedding trip, you and your dear
      departed sang, at my request, that lovely thing, &lsquo;La ci darem la mano.&rsquo;
      (What a fine voice Captain Arundel had!) I dare say, with such a good
      memory as yours, you will remember how the late Sir Pinchbeck observed
      that it put him in mind of the proudest moment of his life, when at St.
      George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square, his friend, the Very Reverend the Dean of
      Dinnerton, made him the happy husband of the relict of the late John
      Girkin. Ah! my dear madam, we widows learn to sympathise with misfortune;
      one does not survive two such men as the late Mr. Girkin, though he was
      somewhat peppery at times, and the late lamented Sir Pinchbeck Lombard, in
      spite of his fidgety ways and chronic cough, without feeling that a vale
      of tears is not desirable for a permanency. If it would be any convenience
      to you when you part with your cottage (I am looking out for a tenant for
      it) to stay with me for a week or ten days, I shall be happy to receive
      you, and would ask a few influential families to hear you sing some
      evening, which might prove useful to you. Of course I cannot expect you to
      part with your daughter, as she will so soon have to quit you (I mentioned
      her to my friend Lady Babbycome, but she was provided with a governess),
      and wish you to understand my invitation extends to her also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, dear Madam, ever your very sincere friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah Matilda Lombard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Would your son like to go to Norfolk Island for fourteen
      years? I think I know a way of sending him free of expense. The climate is
      said to produce a very beneficial effect on the British constitution; and
      with a salary of sixty pounds a year, and an introduction to the best
      society the Island affords, a young man in your son&rsquo;s circumstances would
      scarcely be justified in refusing the post of junior secretary to the
      governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the woman mad?&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis impetuously, as he finished reading
      the foregoing letter, &ldquo;or what right has she to insult us in this manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insult us, my dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Arundel quickly, disregarding a
      deprecatory look from Rose. &ldquo;Lady Lombard has answered my note informing
      her that I wished for musical pupils with equal kindness and promptitude.
      Mad, indeed! she is considered a very superior woman by many people, I can
      assure you, and her generosity and good nature know no bounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perish such generosity!&rdquo; was Lewis&rsquo;s angry rejoinder. &ldquo;Is it not
      bitterness enough to have one&rsquo;s energies cramped, one&rsquo;s free-will fettered
      by the curse of poverty, but you must advertise our wretchedness to the
      world, and put it in the power of a woman, whose pride of purse and
      narrowness of mind stand forth in every line of that hateful letter, to
      buy a right to insult us with her patronage? You might at least have
      waited till you knew you had no other alternative left. What right have
      you to degrade <i>me</i>, by letting yourself down to sue for the charity
      of <i>any one?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Lewis,&rdquo; murmured Rose, imploringly, &ldquo;remember it is mamma you are
      speaking to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, I do remember it; but it is the thought that it <i>is</i> my
      mother, my honoured father&rsquo;s widow, who, by her own imprudence, to use the
      mildest term, has brought this insult upon us, that maddens me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Lewis,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Arundel, equally surprised and alarmed at
      this unexpected outburst, &ldquo;I cannot understand what all this fuss is
      about; I see no insult; on the contrary, Lady Lombard writes as kindly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation of ungovernable anger burst from Lewis, and he appeared on
      the point of losing all self-control, when Rose, catching his eye, glanced
      for a moment towards her father&rsquo;s portrait. Well did she read the generous
      though fiery nature of him with whom she had to deal: no sooner did Lewis
      perceive the direction of her gaze, than, by a strong effort, he checked
      all further expression of his feelings, and turning towards the window,
      stood apparently looking out for some minutes. At length he said abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, you must forgive me; I am hot and impetuous, and all this has
      taken me so completely by surprise. After all, it was only my affection
      for you and Rose which made me resent your patronising friend&rsquo;s
      impertinent benevolence; but the fact is, I hope and believe you have been
      premature in asking her assistance. I have little doubt I shall succeed in
      obtaining a situation or employment of some kind, which will be
      sufficiently lucrative to prevent the necessity of your either giving up
      the cottage, or being separated from Rose. I have written to Frere about
      it, and expect to hear from him in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, would you have us live here in idleness and luxury, while
      you are working yourself to death to enable us to do so?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Arundel, her affection for her son overcoming any feeling of anger which
      his opposition to her pet scheme had excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see that the working need involve my death,&rdquo; replied Lewis.
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he added, with a smile, &ldquo;you would prefer my embracing our Lady
      Patroness&rsquo;s scheme of a fourteen years&rsquo; sojourn in Norfolk Island. I think
      I could accomplish that object without troubling anybody: I have only to
      propitiate the Home Office by abstracting a few silver spoons,&mdash;and
      Government, in its fatherly care, would send me there free of expense, and
      probably introduce me to the best society the Island affords, into the
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear Lady Lombard! I must confess that part of her letter was rather
      absurd,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Arundel; &ldquo;but we must talk more about this plan of
      yours, Lewis; I never can consent to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You both can and will, my dear mother,&rdquo; replied Lewis, playfully but
      firmly; &ldquo;however, we will leave this matter in abeyance till I hear from
      Frere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus, peace being restored, they sat down to breakfast forthwith,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis feeling thankful that he had restrained his anger ere it had led him
      to say words to his mother which he would have regretted deeply
      afterwards, and amply repaid for any effort it might have cost him by the
      bright smile and grateful pressure of the hand with which his sister
      rewarded him. Happy the man whose guardian angel assumes the form of such
      a sister and friend as Rose Arundel!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rachel was spared the trouble of calling her young master the following
      morning, as, when that worthy woman, animated with the desperate courage
      of the leader of a forlorn hope, approached his room, determined to have
      him up in spite of any amount of the languages of modern Europe to which
      she might be exposed, she found the door open and the bird flown; the fact
      being that Lewis and Faust were taking a scamper across the country, to
      their mutual delectation, and the alarming increase of their respective
      appetites. Moreover, Faust, in his ignorance of the Game Laws and the
      Zoology of the land of his adoption, would persist in looking for a wolf
      in the preserves of Squire Tilbury, and while thus engaged could not
      resist the temptation of killing a hare, just by way of keeping his jaws
      in practice; owing to which little escapade he got his master into a row
      with an underkeeper, who required first knocking down and then
      propitiating by a half-sovereign before he could be brought to see the
      matter in a reasonable light.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gave a little interest and excitement to his morning ramble, and
      Lewis returned to breakfast in a high state of health and spirits. A
      letter from his friend Frere awaited his arrival; it ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lewis,&mdash;If you really mean what you say (and you are not the
      man I take you to be if you don&rsquo;t), I know of just the thing to suit you.
      The pay is above your mark, so that&rsquo;s all right; and as to the work&mdash;well,
      it has its disagreeables, that&rsquo;s not to be gainsaid; but life is not
      exactly a bed of roses&mdash;or, if it is, the thorns have got the start
      of the flowers nine times out of ten, as you will know before long, if you
      have not found it out already. In these sort of matters (not that you know
      anything about the matter yet, but I do, which is all the same) it is half
      the battle to be first in the field; <i>ergo</i>, if £300 a year will suit
      your complaint, get on the top of the first coach that will bring you to
      town, and be with me in time for dinner. I have asked a man to meet you,
      who knows all about the thing I have in view for you. Pray remember me to
      Mrs. Arundel and your sister, although I have not as yet the pleasure of
      their personal acquaintance. Don&rsquo;t get into the dolefuls, and fancy
      yourself a victim; depend upon it, you are nothing of the kind. Mutton on
      table at half-past six, and Faust is specially invited to eat the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So good-bye till we meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours for ever and a day,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Frere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Lews, handing the epistle to his mother, &ldquo;now that&rsquo;s
      something like a letter: Frere&rsquo;s a thorough good fellow, every inch of
      him, and a real true friend into the bargain. I&rsquo;ll take whatever it is he
      has found for me, if it is even to black shoes all day; you and Rose shall
      remain here, and Lady Lombard may go to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred a year! Why, my dear Lewis, it&rsquo;s quite a little fortune for
      you!&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Arundel delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what the situation can be?&rdquo; said Rose, regarding her brother
      with a look of affection and regret, as she thought how his proud spirit
      and sensitive nature unfitted him to contend with the calculating policy
      and keen-eyed selfishness of worldly men. Rose had of late been her
      father&rsquo;s confidante, and even adviser, in some of his matters of business,
      and had observed the tone of civil indifference or condescending
      familiarity which the denizens of Vanity Fair assume towards men of broken
      fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Arundel, &ldquo;as you say, Rose, what can it be? something
      in one of the Government offices, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curator of Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s Exhibition, and Master of the Robes to the
      waxwork figures, more likely,&rdquo; replied Lewis, laughing. &ldquo;Or what say you
      to a civic appointment? Mace-bearer to the Lord Mayor, for instance;
      though I believe it requires a seven years&rsquo; apprenticeship to eating
      turtle soup and venison to entitle one to such an honour. Seriously,
      though, if Frere wishes me to take it, I will, whatever it may be, after
      all his kindness to me, and Faust too. Faust, <i>mein kind!</i> here&rsquo;s an
      invitation for you, and a mutton bone in prospect&mdash;hold up your head,
      my dog, you are come to honour.&rdquo; And thus Lewis rattled on, partly because
      the ray of sunshine that gleamed on his darkened fortunes had sufficed to
      raise his naturally buoyant spirits, and partly to prevent the possibility
      of his mother offering any effectual resistance to his wish&mdash;or, more
      properly speaking, his resolution&mdash;to devote himself to the one
      object of supporting her and Rose in their present position.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well for the success of his scheme that Mrs. Arundel had, on the
      strength of the £300 per annum, allowed her imagination to depict some
      distinguished appointment (of what nature she had not the most distant
      notion), which, with innumerable prospective advantages, was about to be
      submitted to her son&rsquo;s consideration. Dazzled by this brilliant phantom,
      she allowed herself to be persuaded to write a civil rejection of Lady
      Lombard&rsquo;s patronage, and took leave of her son with an April face, in
      which, after a short struggle, the smiles had it all their own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose neither laughed nor cried, but she clung to her brother&rsquo;s neck
      (standing on tiptoe to do it, for she was so good, every bit of her, that
      Nature could not afford to make a very tall woman out of such precious
      materials), and whispered to him, in her sweet, silvery voice, if he
      should not quite like this appointment, or if he ever for a moment wished
      to change his plan, how very happy it would make her to be allowed to go
      out and earn money by teaching, just for a few years, till they grew
      richer; and Lewis pressed her to his heart, and loved her so well for
      saying it, ay, and meaning it too, that he felt he would die rather than
      let her do it. And so two people who cared for each other more than for
      all the world beside, parted, having, after a three years&rsquo; separation,
      enjoyed each other&rsquo;s society for two days. Not that there was anything
      remarkable in this, it being a notorious though inexplicable fact that the
      more we like people, the less we are certain to see of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have wearied our brain in the vain endeavour to find a reason for this
      phenomenon, and should feel greatly indebted to any philosophical
      individual who would write a treatise on &ldquo;The perversity of remote
      contingencies, and the aggravating nature of things in general,&rdquo; whereby
      some light might be thrown upon this obscure subject. We recommend the
      matter more particularly to the notice of the British Association of
      Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having seated Lewis on the box of a real good old-fashioned stage
      coach (alas! that, Dodo-like, the genus should be all but extinct, and
      nothing going, nowadays, but those wonderful, horrible, convenient,
      stupendous nuisances, railroads; rattling, with their &ldquo;resonant
      steam-eagles,&rdquo; as Mrs. Browning calls the locomotives), with Faust between
      his knees, apparently studying with the air of a connoisseur the &ldquo;get up&rdquo;
       of a spanking team of greys, we will leave him to prosecute his journey to
      London; reserving for another chapter the adventures which befell him in
      the modern Babylon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;IN WHICH RICHARD FRERE MENDS THE BACK OF ST. THOMAS
      AQUINAS, AND THE READER IS INTRODUCED TO CHARLEY LEICESTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ichard Frere lived
      in a moderate-sized house in a street in the vicinity of Bedford Square.
      It was not exactly a romantic situation, neither was it aristocratic nor
      fashionable; but it was respectable and convenient, and therefore had
      Frere chosen it; for he was a practical man in the proper sense of the
      term&mdash;by which we do not mean that he thought James Watt greater than
      Shakespeare, but that he possessed that rare quality, good common sense,
      and regulated his conduct by it; and as in the course of this veracious
      history we shall hear and see a good deal of Richard Frere, it may tend to
      elucidate matters if we tell the reader at once who and what he was, and
      &ldquo;in point of fact,&rdquo; as Cousin Phoenix would say, all about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Robinson Crusoe, Richard Frere was born of respectable parents. His
      father was the representative of a family who in Saxon days would have
      been termed &ldquo;Franklins&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., a superior class of yeomen,
      possessed of certain broad acres, which they farmed themselves. The
      grandfather Frere having, in a moment of ambition, sent his eldest son to
      Eton, was made aware of his error when the young hopeful on leaving school
      declared his intention of going to college, and utterly repudiated the
      plough-tail. Having a very decided will of his own, and a zealous
      supporter in his mother, to college he went, and thence to a special
      pleader, to read for the bar. Being really clever, and determined to prove
      to his father the wisdom of the course he had adopted, sufficiently
      industrious also, he got into very tolerable practice. On one occasion,
      having been retained in a well-known contested peerage case, by his
      acuteness and eloquence he gained his cause, and at the same time the
      affections of the successful disputant&rsquo;s younger sister. His noble client
      very ungratefully opposed the match, but love and law together proved too
      powerful for his lordship. One fine evening the young lady made a
      moonlight flitting of it, and before twelve o&rsquo;clock on the following
      morning had become Mrs. Frere. Within a year from this event Richard Frere
      made his appearance at the cradle terminus of the railroad of life. When
      he was six years old, his father, after speaking for three hours, in a
      cause in which he was leader, more eloquently than he had ever before
      done, broke a blood-vessel, and was carried home a dying man. His wife
      loved him as woman alone can love&mdash;for his sake she had given up
      friends, fortune, rank, and the pleasures and embellishments of life; for
      his sake she now gave up life itself. Grief does not always kill quickly,
      yet Richard&rsquo;s ninth birthday was spent among strangers. His noble uncle,
      who felt that by neglecting his sister on her death-bed he had done his
      duty to his pedigree handsomely, and might now give way to family
      affection, sent the orphan to school at Westminster, and even allowed him
      to run wild at Bellefield Park during the holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>agrémens</i> of a public school, acting on a sensitive disposition,
      gave a tone of bitterness to the boy&rsquo;s mind, which would have rendered him
      a misanthrope but for a strong necessity for loving something (the only
      inheritance his poor mother had left him), which developed itself in
      attachment to unsympathising silkworms and epicurean white mice during his
      early boyhood, and in a <i>bizarre</i> but untiring benevolence in
      after-life, leading him to take endless trouble for the old and
      unattractive, and to devote himself, body and soul, to forward the
      interest of those who were fortunate enough to possess his friendship. Of
      the latter class Lewis Arundel had been one since the day when Frere, a
      stripling of seventeen, fought his rival, the cock of the school, for
      having thrashed the new-comer in return for his accidental transgression
      of some sixth-form etiquette. Ten years had passed over their heads since
      that day: the cock of the school was a judge in Ceylon, weighed sixteen
      stone, and had a wife and six little children; Richard Frere was secretary
      to a scientific institution, with a salary of £400 a year, and a general
      knowledge of everything of which other people were ignorant; and little
      Lewis Arundel was standing six feet high, waiting to be let in at the door
      of his friend&rsquo;s house, in the respectable and convenient street near
      Bedford Square, to which he and Faust had found their way, after a
      prosperous journey by the coach, on the roof of which we left them at the
      end of the last chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman ugly enough to frighten a horse, and old enough for <i>anything</i>,
      replied in the affirmative to Lewis&rsquo;s inquiry whether her master was at
      home, and led the way upstairs, glancing suspiciously at Faust as she did
      so. On reaching the first landing she tapped at the door; a full, rich,
      but somewhat gruff voice shouted &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and Lewis, passing his ancient
      conductress, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Lewis, old boy! how are you? Don&rsquo;t touch me, I can&rsquo;t shake hands,
      I&rsquo;m all over paste; I have been mending the backs of two of the old
      Fathers that I picked up, dirt cheap, at a bookstall as I was coming home
      to-day: one of them is a real <i>editio princeps</i>&mdash;Why, man, how
      you are grown! Is that Faust? Come here, dog&mdash;what a beauty! Ah! you
      brute, keep your confounded nose out of the paste-pot, do! I must give
      Aquinas another dab yet. Sit down, man, if you can find a chair&mdash;bundle
      those books under the table. There we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker, who, as the reader has probably conjectured, was none other
      than Mr. Richard Frere, presented at that moment as singular an appearance
      as any gentleman not an Ojibbeway Indian, or other natural curiosity for
      public exhibition in the good city of London, need to do. His apparent age
      was somewhat under thirty. His face would have been singularly ugly but
      for three redeeming points&mdash;a high, intellectual forehead; full,
      restless blue eyes, beaming with intelligence; and a bright benevolent
      smile, which disclosed a brilliant set of white, even teeth, compensating
      for the disproportioned width of the mouth which contained them. His hair
      and whiskers, of a rich brown, hung in elf locks about his face and head,
      which were somewhat too large for his height; his chest and shoulders were
      also disproportionately broad, giving him an appearance of great strength,
      which indeed he possessed. He was attired in a chintz dressing-gown that
      had once rejoiced in a pattern of gaudy colours, but was now reduced to a
      neutral tint of (we may as well confess it at once) London smoke. He was,
      moreover, for the greater convenience of the pasting operation, seated
      cross-legged on the floor, amidst a hecatomb of ponderous volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received your letter this morning,&rdquo; began Lewis, &ldquo;and, as you see, lost
      no time in being with you; and now what is it you have heard of, Frere?
      But first let me thank you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank me!&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;for what? I have done nothing yet, except
      writing a dozen lines to tell you to take a dusty journey, and leave green
      trees and nightingales for smoke and bustle&mdash;nothing very kind in
      that, is there? Just look at the dog&rsquo;s-ears&mdash;St. Augustine&rsquo;s, I mean,
      not Faust&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease me, there&rsquo;s a good fellow,&rdquo; returned Lewis; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a
      humour for jesting at present. I have gone through a good deal in one way
      or other since you and I last met, and am no longer the light-hearted boy
      you knew me, but a man, and well-nigh a desperate one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; rejoined Frere, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the style of thing, is it? Yes; I know all
      about it. I met Kirschberg the other day, with a beard like a cow&rsquo;s tail,
      and he told me that Gretchen had bolted with the Baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mention her name, if you would not drive me mad,&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis,
      springing from his chair and pacing the room impatiently. His friend
      regarded him attentively for a moment, and then uncrossing his legs, and
      muttering to himself that he had got the cramp, and should make a shocking
      bad Turk, rose, approached Lewis, and laying his hand on his shoulder,
      said gravely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Lewis: you trusted, and have been deceived; and, by a not
      unnatural revulsion of feeling, your faith in man&rsquo;s honour and woman&rsquo;s
      constancy is for the time being destroyed; and just at the very moment
      when you most require the assistance of your old friends, and the
      determination to gain new ones, you dislike and despise your
      fellow-creatures, and are at war in your heart with society. Now this must
      not be, and at the risk of paining you, I am going to tell you the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you would say,&rdquo; interrupted Lewis vehemently: &ldquo;you would tell
      me that my affection was misplaced&mdash;that I loved a girl beneath me in
      mind and station&mdash;that I trusted a man whom I deemed my friend, but
      who, with a specious exterior, was a cold-hearted, designing villain. It
      was so; I own it; I see it <i>now</i>, when it is too late; but I did not
      see it at the time when the knowledge might have availed me. And why may
      not this happen again? There is but one way to prevent it: I will avoid
      the perfidious sex&mdash;except Rose, no woman shall ever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, don&rsquo;t talk such rubbish,&rdquo; interposed his friend; &ldquo;there are
      plenty of right-minded, lovable women in the world, I don&rsquo;t doubt, though
      I can&rsquo;t say I have much to do with them, seeing that they are not usually
      addicted to practical science, and therefore don&rsquo;t come in my way&mdash;household
      angels, with their wings clipped, and their manners and their draperies
      modernised, but with all the brightness and purity of heaven still
      lingering about them,&mdash;that&rsquo;s my notion of women as they should be,
      and as I believe many are, despite your having been jilted by as arrant a
      little coquette as ever I had the luck to behold; and as to the Baron, it
      would certainly be a satisfaction to kick him well; but we can&rsquo;t obtain
      all we wish for in this life. What are you grinning at? You don&rsquo;t mean to
      say you <i>have</i> polished him off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In reply, Lewis drew his left arm out of his coat, and rolling up his
      shirt-sleeve above the elbow, exposed to view a newly-healed wound in the
      fleshy part of his arm, then said quietly, &ldquo;We fought with small swords in
      a ring formed by the students; we were twenty minutes at it; he marked me
      as you see; at length I succeeded in disarming him&mdash;in the struggle
      he fell, and placing my foot upon his neck and my sword point to his
      heart, I forced him to confess his treachery, and beg his hateful life of
      me before them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere&rsquo;s face grew dark. &ldquo;Duelling!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought your principles
      would have preserved you from that vice&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A growl from Faust, whose quick ear had detected a footstep on the stairs,
      interrupted him, and in another moment a voice exclaimed, &ldquo;Hello, Frere!
      where are you, man?&rdquo; and the speaker, without waiting for an answer,
      opened the door and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer was a fashionably-dressed young man, with a certain air
      about him as if he were somebody, and knew it&mdash;he was good-looking,
      had dark hair, most desirably curling whiskers; and, though he was in a
      morning costume, was evidently &ldquo;got up&rdquo; regardless of expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his large eyes and stared with a look of languid wonder at
      Lewis, then, turning to Frere, he said, &ldquo;Ah! I did not know you were
      engaged, Richard, or I would have allowed your old lady to announce me in
      due form; as it was, I thought, in my philanthropy, to save her a journey
      upstairs was a good deed, for she is getting a little touched in the wind.
      May I ask,&rdquo; he continued, glancing at Lewis&rsquo;s bare arm, &ldquo;were you
      literally, and not figuratively, bleeding your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; replied Frere, laughing. &ldquo;But you must know each other:
      this is my particular friend, Lewis Arundel, whom I was telling you of,&mdash;Lewis,
      my cousin Charles Leicester, Lord Ashford&rsquo;s youngest son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse luck,&rdquo; replied the gentleman thus introduced; &ldquo;younger sons being
      one of those unaccountable mistakes of Nature which it requires an immense
      amount of faith to acquiesce in with proper orthodoxy: the popular
      definition of a younger son&rsquo;s portion, &lsquo;A good set of teeth, and nothing
      to eat,&rsquo; shows the absurdity of the thing. Where do you find any other
      animal in such a situation? Where&mdash;&mdash;But perhaps we have
      scarcely time to do the subject proper justice at present; I have some
      faint recollection of your having asked me to dine at half-past six, on
      the strength of which I cut short my canter in the park, and lost a chance
      of inspecting a prize widow, whom Sullivan had marked down for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say it is as late as that?&rdquo; exclaimed Frere.
      &ldquo;Thomas Aquinas has taken longer to splice than I was aware of; to be
      sure, his back was dreadfully shattered. Excuse me half a minute; I&rsquo;ll
      just wash the paste off my hands, make myself decent, and be with you in
      no time.&rdquo; As he spoke he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a life for a reasonable being to lead!&rdquo; observed Leicester, flinging
      himself back in Frere&rsquo;s reading-chair. &ldquo;Now that fellow was as happy with
      his paste-pot as I should be if some benevolent individual in the Fairy
      Tale and Good Genius line were to pay my debts and marry me to an heiress
      with £10,000 a year. An inordinate affection for books will be that man&rsquo;s
      destruction. You have known him some years, I think, Mr. Arundel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis replied in the affirmative, and Leicester continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you perceive that he is greatly altered? He stoops like an old man,
      sir; his eyes are getting weak,&mdash;it&rsquo;s an even chance whether he is
      shaved or not; he looks upon brushes as superfluities, and eschews bears&rsquo;
      grease entirely, not to mention a very decided objection to the operations
      of the hair-cutter; then the clothes he wears,&mdash;where he contrives to
      get such things I can&rsquo;t conceive, unless they come out of Monmouth Street,
      and then they would be better cut; but the worst of it is, he has no
      proper feeling about it,&mdash;perfectly callous!&rdquo; He sighed, and then
      resumed. &ldquo;It was last Saturday, I think,&mdash; &rsquo;pon my word, you
      will scarcely believe it, but it&rsquo;s true, I do assure you: I had given my
      horse to the groom, and was lounging by the Serpentine, with Egerton of
      the Guards, and Harry Vain, who is about the best dressed man in London, a
      little after five o&rsquo;clock, and the park as full as it could hold, when who
      should I see, striding along like a postman among the swells, but Master
      Richard Frere! And how do you suppose he was dressed? We&rsquo;ll begin at the
      top, and take him downwards: Imprimis, a shocking bad hat, set on the back
      of his head, after the fashion of the <i>he</i> peasants in a pastoral
      chorus at the Opera House; a seedy black coat, with immense flaps, and a
      large octavo edition of St. Senanus, or some of them, sticking out of the
      pocket; a white choker villainously tied, which looked as if he had slept
      in it the night before; a most awful waistcoat, black-and-white plaid
      trousers guiltless of straps, worsted stockings, and a clumsy species of
      shooting shoes; and because all this was not enough, he had a large
      umbrella, although the day was lovely, and a basket in his hand, with the
      neck of a black bottle peeping out of it, containing port wine, which it
      seems he was conveying to a superannuated nurse of his who hangs out at
      Kensington. I turned my head away, hoping that as he was staring intently
      at something in the water, he might not recognise me; but it was of no
      use. Just as Egerton, who did not know him, exclaimed, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a natural
      curiosity! Did you ever see such a Guy in your life?&rsquo; he looked up and saw
      me: in another minute his great paw was laid upon my shoulder, and I was
      accosted thus:&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, Leicester! you here? Just look at that duck with
      the grey bill; that&rsquo;s a very rare bird indeed; it comes from Central Asia.
      I did not know they had a specimen in this country; it is one of the Teal
      family,&mdash;<i>Querquedula Glocitans</i>, the bimaculated teal,&mdash;so
      called from two bright spots near the eye. Look, you can see them now,&mdash;very
      rare bird,&mdash;very rare bird indeed!&rsquo; And so he ran on, till suddenly
      recollecting that he was in a hurry, he shook my hand till my arm ached
      (dropping the umbrella on Vain&rsquo;s toes as he did so) and posted off,
      leaving me to explain to my companions how it was possible such an
      apparition should have been seen in any place except Bedlam. Richard
      Frere&rsquo;s a right good fellow, and I have an immense respect for him, but he
      is a very trying relative to meet in Hyde Park during the London season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered himself of this sentiment, the Honourable Charles, or, as
      he was more commonly denominated by his intimates, Charley Leicester,
      leaned back in his chair, apparently overcome by the recollections his
      tale had excited, in which position he remained, cherishing his whiskers,
      till their host reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was exactly such a meal as one gentleman of moderate income
      should give to two others, not particularly gourmands; that is, there was
      enough to eat and drink, and everything was excellent of its kind; one of
      those mysterious individuals who exist only in large cities and fairy
      tales having provided the entire affair, and waited at table like a duke&rsquo;s
      butler into the bargain. When the meal was concluded, and the good genius
      had vanished, after placing before them a most inviting magnum of claret,
      and said &ldquo;Yessir&rdquo; for the last time, Frere turned to Lewis, and observed,
      &ldquo;By the way, Arundel, I dare say you are anxious to hear about this
      appointment, or situation, or whatever the correct term may be,&mdash;the
      thing I mentioned to you. My cousin Charles can tell you all there is to
      hear concerning the matter, for the good folks are his friends, and not
      mine; indeed, I scarcely know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, Charley Leicester filled a bumper of claret, seated
      himself in an easy attitude, examined his well-turned leg and
      unexceptionable boot with a full appreciation of their respective merits,
      and then sipping his wine and addressing Lewis, began as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Arundel, this is the true state of the case, as far as I know
      about it. You may perhaps be acquainted with the name of General Grant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis replied in the negative, and Leicester continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, I forgot, you have been on the Continent for some time; however,
      the General is member for A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and a man very
      well known about town. Now, he happens to be a sort of cousin of mine&mdash;my
      mother, Lady Ashford, was a Grant; and for that reason, or some other, the
      General has taken a liking to me, and generously affords me his
      countenance and protection. So, when I have nothing better to do, I go and
      vegetate at Broadhurst, an old rambling place in H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shire,
      that has been in his family since the flood&mdash;splendid shooting,
      though; he preserves strictly, and transports a colony of poachers every
      year. I was sitting with him the other day, when he suddenly began asking
      about Frere, where he was, what he was doing, and all the rest of it. So I
      related that he was secretary to a learned society, and was popularly
      supposed to know more than all the <i>scavans</i> in Europe and the Dean
      of Dustandstir put together. Whereupon he began muttering, &lsquo;Unfortunate!&mdash;
      he was just the person&mdash;learned man&mdash;good family&mdash;well
      connected&mdash;most unlucky!&rsquo; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, General?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;A
      very annoying affair, Charles&mdash;a very great responsibility has
      devolved upon me, a matter of extreme moment&mdash;clear;£ 12,000 a year,
      and a long minority.&rsquo; &lsquo;Has;£12,000 a year devolved upon you, sir?&rsquo;
      returned I. &lsquo;I wish Dame Fortune would try me with some such
      responsibility.&rsquo; In reply he gave me the following account:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appeared that one of his most intimate friends and neighbours, an old
      baronet, had lately departed this life; the title and estates descend to a
      grandson, a minor, and General Grant had been appointed guardian. All this
      was bad enough, but the worst was yet to come&mdash;he had promised his
      dying friend that the boy should reside in his house. Now it seems that,
      as a sort of set-off against his luck in coming into the world with a gold
      spoon in his mouth, the said boy was born with even less brains than
      usually fall to the lot of Fortune&rsquo;s favourites&mdash;in plain English, he
      is half an idiot. Accordingly, the General&rsquo;s first care was to provide the
      young bear with a leader, and in his own mind he had fixed on Frere, whom
      he knew by reputation, as the man, and was grievously disappointed when he
      found he was bespoke. I suggested that, although he could not undertake
      the duty himself, he might possibly know some one who could, and offered
      to ascertain. The General jumped at the idea&mdash;<i>hinc illae lachrymae</i>&mdash;hence
      the whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I received your letter,&rdquo; began Frere, &ldquo;Leicester came in to make
      the inquiry. In fact the thing fitted like the advertisements in <i>The
      Times</i>&mdash;&lsquo;Wants a situation as serious footman in a pious family;
      wages not so much an object as moral cultivation.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Wanted in a
      pious family, a decidedly serious footman, wages moderate, but the
      spiritual advantages unexceptionable.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;If A. B. is not utterly
      perfidious, and lost to all the noblest feelings of humanity, he will
      forward a small enclosure to C. D. at Mrs. Bantam&rsquo;s, oilman, Tothill
      Street.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;A. B. is desirous of communicating with C. D.; if
      forgiven, he will never do so no more, at any price.&rsquo; You may see lots of
      them in the advertising sheet; they are like angry women, sure to answer
      one another if you leave them alone. And now, what do you think of the
      notion, Lewis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there are one or two points to be considered,&rdquo; replied Lewis. &ldquo;In
      the first place, what would be the duties of the situation? In the second,
      am I fitted to perform them? In the third&mdash;&mdash; But, however, I
      have named the most important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the duties,&rdquo; replied Leicester, &ldquo;I should fancy they would be
      anything but overpowering&mdash;rather in the nothing-to-do-and-a-man-to
      help-you style than otherwise. All the General said was, &lsquo;Mind, I must
      have a <i>gentleman</i>, a person who is accustomed to the rank of life in
      which he will have to move&mdash;he must be a young man, or he will not
      readily fall into my habits and wishes. As he is to live in my family, he
      must be altogether presentable. His chief duty will be to endeavour to
      develop my ward&rsquo;s mind, and fit him for the position which his rank and
      fortune render it incumbent on him to occupy.&rsquo; To which speech, delivered
      in a very stately manner, I merely said, &lsquo;Yes, exactly;&rsquo; a style of remark
      to which no exception could reasonably be taken, unless on the score of
      want of originality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the General in town, Charley?&rdquo; asked Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is waiting about this very business,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, the best thing will be for you to take Arundel there to-morrow
      morning, and bring them face to face; that is the way to do business,
      depend upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not that be giving Mr. Leicester a great deal of trouble?&rdquo; suggested
      Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Leicester, good-naturedly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call
      for you at twelve o&rsquo;clock, and drive you up to Park Crescent in my cab.
      Having once taken the matter in hand, I am anxious to bring it to a
      satisfactory conclusion&mdash;besides, a man must lunch, and the General&rsquo;s
      pale ale is by no means to be despised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the servant entered, and handing Frere a card, informed him
      the gentleman wished to speak with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to walk in. Say that I have one or two friends taking wine with
      me, and that I hope he will join us. Now, Lewis, I will introduce you to
      an original&mdash;you know him, Leicester&mdash;Marmaduke Grandeville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>De</i> Grandeville, my dear fellow&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget the <i>De</i>
      unless you intend him to call you out. What, is &lsquo;the Duke&rsquo; coming? Yes, I
      certainly do know him, <i>rather</i>&mdash;just a very little.&rdquo; Then,
      speaking in an affected yet pompous tone, he continued&mdash;&ldquo;Ar&mdash;really&mdash;yes&mdash;<i>the</i>
      De Grandevilles&mdash;very old Yorkshire family in the West Riding&mdash;came
      in with the Conqueror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly like him,&rdquo; exclaimed Frere, laughing. &ldquo;Hush! here he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the door opened slowly, and a head with a hat on first
      appeared, then followed a pair of broad shoulders, and lastly the whole
      man entered bodily. Drawing himself up with a stiff military air, he
      closed the door, and slightly raising his hat, shaded his eyes with it,
      while he reconnoitred the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, come along in, man; you know Charles Leicester&mdash;this is an
      old Westminster friend of mine, Lewis Arundel: now here&rsquo;s a clean glass;
      take some claret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The individual thus addressed made the slightest possible acknowledgment
      on being introduced to Lewis, favoured Leicester with a military salute,
      laid a large heavy hand adorned with a ring of strange and antique fashion
      patronisingly on Frere&rsquo;s shoulder, poured himself out a glass of wine, and
      then wheeling round majestically to the fire, and placing his glass on the
      chimney-piece, faced the company with an air equally dignified and
      mysterious, thereby affording Lewis a good opportunity of examining his
      appearance. He was above the middle height and powerfully made, so much so
      as to give his clothes, which were fashionably cut, the air of being a
      size too small for him. He wore his coat buttoned tightly across his
      chest, which he carried well forward after the manner of a cuirassier;
      indeed, his whole gait and bearing were intensely military. His age might
      be two or three-and-thirty; he had dark hair and whiskers, good though
      rather coarse features, and a more ruddy complexion than usually falls to
      the lot of a Londoner. After sipping his wine leisurely, he folded his
      arms with an air of importance, and fixing his eyes significantly on the
      person addressed, said, &ldquo;Ar&mdash;Leicester, how is it Lord Ashford
      happens to be out of town just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;my father is not
      usually in the habit of explaining his movements, particularly to such an
      unimportant individual as myself. I have a vague idea Bellefield wrote to
      beg him to come down for something&mdash;he&rsquo;s at the Park, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes, you must not be surprised if you see him in Belgrave Square
      to-morrow; <i>we</i> want him; he&rsquo;s been&mdash;ar&mdash;written to
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the deuce do you know that?&rdquo; inquired Frere. &ldquo;I never can make out
      where you contrive to pick up those things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are <i>we?</i>&rdquo; inquired Lewis in an undertone of Leicester, near
      whom he was seated. &ldquo;Does Mr. Grandeville belong to the Government?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not really, only in imagination,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;<i>We</i> means himself
      and the other Whig magnates of the land, in this instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you did not really know Graves was dead?&rdquo; continued Grandeville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite certain that I even knew he was alive,&rdquo; replied Leicester.
      &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A significant smile, saying plainly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fancy I am going to believe
      you as ignorant as you pretend,&rdquo; floated across Grandeville&rsquo;s face ere he
      continued: &ldquo;You need not be so cautious with me, I can assure you. The
      moment I heard Graves was given over, I wrote&mdash;ar&mdash;that is, I
      gave the hint to a man who wrote to Lord Bellefield to say the county was
      his; he had only to declare himself, and he would walk over the course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extremely kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Leicester; then turning to
      Lewis, while Grandeville was making some mysterious communication to
      Frere, he added in an undertone, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie from beginning to end. I
      had a note from Bellefield (he&rsquo;s my <i>frere aîné</i>, you know) this
      morning, in which he says, &lsquo;Our county member has been dangerously ill,
      but is now better;&rsquo; and he adds, &lsquo;Some of the fools about here wanted me
      to put up for the county if he popped oft, but I am not going to thrust my
      neck into the collar to please any of them.&rsquo; Bell&rsquo;s too lazy by half for
      an M.P., and small blame to him either.&rdquo; Frere having listened to De
      Grandeville&rsquo;s whispered communication, appeared for a moment embarrassed,
      and then observed&mdash;but an adventure so important as that to which his
      observation related deserves a fresh chapter.

      DANGEROUS EXPEDITION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;I</span> should be happy
      to join you, but you see I am engaged to my friends here,&rdquo; observed Frere
      to Grandeville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would never dream of standing on ceremony with me, Frere, I hope,&rdquo;
       interposed Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we not all go together?&rdquo; inquired Frere; &ldquo;the more the
      merrier, particularly if it should come to a shindy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the nature of the entertainment?&rdquo; asked Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them, De Grandeville,&rdquo; said Frere, looking hard at his cousin, as he
      slightly emphasised the <i>De</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;well, you won&rsquo;t let it go further, I&rsquo;m sure, but there&rsquo;s a
      meeting to be held to-night at a kind of Mechanics&rsquo; Institute, a place I
      and one or two other influential men have had our eyes on for some time
      past, where they promulgate very unsound opinions; and we have been only
      waiting our opportunity to give the thing a check, and show them that the
      landed gentry are united in their determination not to tolerate sedition,
      or in fact anything of the sort; and I have had a hint from a very sure
      quarter (I walked straight from Downing Street here) that to-night they
      are to muster in force&mdash;a regular showoff; so a party of us are going
      to be present and watch the proceedings, and if there should be seditious
      language used, we shall make a decided demonstration, let them feel the
      power they are arraying themselves against, and the utter madness of
      provoking such an unequal struggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we have a very fair chance of a row, I should hope,&rdquo; interposed
      Lewis eagerly, his eyes sparkling with excitement; &ldquo; &rsquo;twill put us
      in mind of old sixth-form days, eh, Frere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leicester, what say you? Do you mind dirtying your kid gloves in the good
      cause?&rdquo; asked Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no time to put on an old coat, I suppose?&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;A
      broken head I don&rsquo;t mind occasionally, it gives one a new sensation; but
      to sacrifice good clothes verges too closely on the wantonly extravagant
      to suit either my pocket or my principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lend you one of mine,&rdquo; returned Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forfend!&rdquo; was the horrified rejoinder. &ldquo;I have too much regard for
      the feelings of my family, let alone those of my tailor, to dream of such
      a thing for a minute. Only suppose anything were to happen to me, just see
      how it would read in the papers: &lsquo;The body of the unfortunate deceased was
      enveloped in a threadbare garment of mysterious fashion; in the enormous
      pockets which undermined its voluminous skirts was discovered, amongst
      other curiosities, the leg-bone of a fossil Iguanodon.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently there!&rdquo; cried Frere; &ldquo;how some people are given to exaggeration!
      Because I happened accidentally one day to pull out two of the vertebræ of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll allow me to interrupt you,&rdquo; began Grandeville, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think you need apprehend any display of physical force; our object
      is, if possible, to produce a moral effect&mdash;in fact, by weight of
      character and position, to impress them with a deep sense of the power and
      resources of the upper classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still a good licking is a very effectual argument where other means of
      persuasion fail. I have great faith in fists,&rdquo; said Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;in the event of our being obliged to have recourse to such
      extreme measures, I must impress upon you the necessity of discipline,&rdquo;
       returned Grandeville. &ldquo;Look to me for orders, ar&mdash;I am not exactly&mdash;ar&mdash;regular
      profession&mdash;ar&mdash;military, though when I was at the headquarters
      of the &mdash;&mdash;th in Ireland last year, they did me the honour to
      say that I had naturally a very unusual strategic turn&mdash;a good
      officer spoiled&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always thought you had a sort of Life-guardsman-like look about you,&rdquo;
       said Leicester, with a sly glance at the others. &ldquo;You often hear of a man
      being one of &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s gentlemen,&rsquo; now I should call you one of &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s
      guardsmen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes, not so bad that,&rdquo; returned Grandeville, the possibility of
      Leicester&rsquo;s meaning to laugh at him faintly occurring to him, and being
      instantly rejected as utterly inconceivable. &ldquo;Here, sir,&rdquo; he continued,
      turning abruptly to Lewis, &ldquo;feel my arm; there&rsquo;s muscle for you! I don&rsquo;t
      say it by way of a boast, but there is not such an arm as that in her
      Majesty&rsquo;s ~*&mdash;th; there was not one of their crack men that could
      hold up so heavy a weight as I could, for I tried the thing when I was
      over at Killandrum last autumn, and beat them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time does your entertainment commence, may I ask?&rdquo; inquired
      Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;I promised to join the others at a quarter before nine; the
      meeting was to commence at nine, and we shall have some little way to
      walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the sooner we are off the better,&rdquo; said Frere. &ldquo;But you expect a
      reinforcement, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;some men, some of our set, you understand, very first-rate
      fellows who have the cause at heart, have agreed to come and carry the
      matter through with a high hand. Failure might produce very serious
      results, but the right measures have been taken; I dropped a hint at the
      Horse Guards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I had better not take Faust,&rdquo; observed Lewis. &ldquo;If there is a
      crowd he will get his toes trodden on, and he is apt to show fight under
      these circumstances. May I leave him here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; replied Frere; &ldquo;that is, if you can persuade him to stay
      quietly, and bind him over to keep the peace till we return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is soon accomplished,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis, and calling the dog to him,
      he dropped a glove on the floor and uttered some German word of command,
      when the well-trained animal immediately laid down with the glove between
      his huge paws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caution your old lady not to interfere with the glove,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;or
      Faust will assuredly throttle her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, is he touchy on that head?&rdquo; inquired Grandeville, poising himself
      on one leg while he endeavoured to kick the glove away with the other. A
      growl like that of an angry tiger, and the display of a set of teeth of
      which a dentist or a crocodile might equally have been proud, induced him
      to draw back his foot with rather more celerity than was altogether in
      keeping with the usual dignity of his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dog has not such a bad notion of producing a moral impression,&rdquo; said
      Leicester, laughing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he might be useful to us to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;now, there is nothing I should like better than to take that
      glove away from him,&rdquo; observed Grandeville, casting a withering glance on
      Faust. &ldquo;Ar&mdash;I wish I had time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had,&rdquo; returned Lewis dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you think it would be so mighty difficult?&rdquo; retorted Grandeville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Rudolph Arnheim, a fellow-student of mine, tried the experiment, I
      had some trouble in choking Faust off before the dog had quite throttled
      him,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Rudolph is no child, and had a heavy wager depending
      on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t see any great difficulty in the thing, but it
      depends on a man&rsquo;s nerve, of course. Now, are we ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Marmaduke Grandeville, Esq., placed his hat firmly on his head,
      and with the gait of a heavy dragoon and the air of a conquering hero,
      marched nobly out of the apartment. Leicester held back to allow Lewis to
      follow, then drawing Frere on one side, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I like your friend Arundel; he is a manly, intelligent young
      fellow, much too good to be bear-leader to a half-witted cub like this
      precious ward of old Grant&rsquo;s; and if I were as rich as I am poor, I would
      do something better for him. Now, if he had but a few hundreds to go on
      with, matrimony would be the dodge for him. With such a face and figure as
      his, he might secure no end of a prize in the wife market; there&rsquo;s a
      thoroughbred look about him which would tell with women amazingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has all the makings of a fine character in him,&rdquo; replied Frere, &ldquo;but
      he is proud and impetuous; and pride and poverty are ill companions,
      though they often go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; replied Leicester. &ldquo;Well, I am poor enough for anything, as a
      very large majority of the metropolitan tradesmen know to their cost, but,
      upon my word, I am not proud. Any man may give me a good dinner, and I&rsquo;ll
      eat it,&mdash;good wine, and I&rsquo;ll drink it; I never refuse a stall at the
      Opera, though the bone may belong to an opulent tallow-chandler; and there
      is not a woman in England with £150,000 that I would not marry to-morrow
      if she would have me. No! I may be poor, but you can&rsquo;t call me proud.&rdquo; And
      placing his arm through that of his cousin, they descended to the street
      together, and rejoined Lewis and his companion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;IS OF A DECIDEDLY WARLIKE CHARACTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he place of
      rendezvous for the &ldquo;gallant defenders of the British constitution,&rdquo; as
      Leicester had designated the little party, was a cigar shop in the
      immediate vicinity of the building in which the meeting was to be held. On
      their arrival they perceived that the shop was already occupied by several
      young men, who were lounging over the counter, bandying jests and
      compliments with a ringleted young lady, who appeared thoroughly
      self-possessed and quite equal to the part she had to perform, having
      through all her pretty coquetries a shrewd eye to business, and reserving
      her most fascinating smiles for the most inveterate smokers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Grandeville entered the shop, which he did with a most lordly and
      dignified air, he was welcomed with general acclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All hail, Macbeth!&rdquo; exclaimed a thin young man, with a white greatcoat
      and a face to match, throwing himself into a tragedy attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most noble commander!&rdquo; began another of the group. &ldquo;Most illustrious De
      Grandeville! how is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your anxious mother?&rdquo; interrupted a short, muscular little fellow, with
      as rich a brogue as ever claimed Cork for its county.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! be quiet, Pat; we have no time for nonsense now, man,&rdquo; cried a tall
      youth with a profusion of light curling hair, a prominent hooked nose, a
      merry smile, and a pair of wicked grey eyes, which appeared to possess the
      faculty of looking in every direction at once. &ldquo;You are late, De
      Grandeville,&rdquo; he added, coming forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;no, sir; five minutes good by the Horse Guards. Ar&mdash;I
      should have been here sooner, but I have been&mdash;ar&mdash;recruiting,
      you see. Mr. Bracy, Mr. Frere, Mr. Arundel&mdash;you know Leicester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to see such an addition to our forces,&rdquo; replied Bracy, bowing;
      then shaking hands with Leicester, he added in an undertone, &ldquo;Walk with me
      when we start; I have a word to say to you.&rdquo; Leicester nodded in assent,
      and then proceeded to accost others of the party with whom he was
      acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;now, gentlemen, will you please to attend to orders?&rdquo; began
      Grandeville, raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; cried the pale young man, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it betther if you&rsquo;d be houldin&rsquo; yer tongue, maybe,&rdquo; interposed
      the hero from Cork, who, being interpreted, was none other than Lieutenant
      McDermott of the Artillery, believed by the Commander-in-Chief to be at
      that very moment on duty at Woolwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;you are to divide yourselves into three or four bodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, we must get blind drunk, and see double twice over then, before we
      can do that,&rdquo; remarked the son of Erin argumentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Paddy, be quiet,&rdquo; said Bracy, soothingly; &ldquo;you know you never got so
      far in your arithmetic as vulgar fractions, so you can&rsquo;t be supposed to
      understand the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A somewhat forcible rejoinder was drowned by Grandeville, who continued,
      in his most sonorous tone: &ldquo;Ar&mdash;you will then proceed to the hall of
      meeting, and make your way quietly to the right side, as near the platform
      as possible. There&mdash;keep together, and attract as little attention as
      you can, and Mr. Bracy will transmit such directions to you as
      circumstances may render advisable. Do you all clearly understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general shout of assent, varied by a muttered &ldquo;Not in the slightest
      degree,&rdquo; from McDermott, was followed by the order, &ldquo;Then march!&rdquo; and in
      another moment the party were <i>en route</i>. The pale young man, who was
      in his secret soul rather alarmed than otherwise, had attached himself
      firmly to Frere, with whom he was slightly acquainted, and who he thought
      would take care of him, so Lewis was left to pair off with Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they proceeded, the latter began: &ldquo;Depend upon it, there&rsquo;s some trick
      in all this, probably intended for Grandeville&rsquo;s benefit; that fellow
      Bracy is one of the most inveterate practical jokers extant, and he seems
      particularly busy to-night; he&rsquo;s a clerk in the Home Office, and
      Grandeville believes in him to an immense extent; but here he comes. Well,
      Bracy, what is it, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your friend safe?&rdquo; inquired Bracy aside, glancing at Lewis as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most cautious man in London,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and one who appreciates
      our noble commander thoroughly; so now allow us a peep behind the scenes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the matter stands thus,&rdquo; returned Bracy. &ldquo;I was walking with Duke
      Grandeville one night about three weeks ago, when we chanced to encounter
      the good folks coming away from one of these meetings; they were nothing
      very formidable&mdash;a fair sample of young Newgate Street, youthful
      patriots from Snow Hill, embryo republicans of St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard,
      Barbican, and other purlieus of Cockaignia, led by a few choice spirits&mdash;copying
      clerks, who hide their heroism from the light of day in lawyers&rsquo; offices,
      booksellers&rsquo; shopmen from the Row, who regard themselves as distinguished
      literary characters, and prate of the sovereignty of the press, and the
      like. Well, as might be expected, they discoursed most ferociously, and
      the Duke, overhearing some of their conversation, was deeply scandalised,
      and fancied he had discovered a second Cato Street conspiracy. The thing
      appeared to promise fun, so I encouraged him in the idea, and we attended
      the next meeting, when they talked the usual style of radical clap-trap.
      Everything was an abuse&mdash;the rich were tyrants, the poor slaves, and
      property required transferring (<i>i.e</i>., from its present possessors
      to themselves); they knew they never should be kings, so they cried down
      monarchy; but they trusted that, with strong lungs and good-luck, they
      might become paid delegates, therefore they clamoured for a republic.
      There was much noise, but no talent; sanguinary theories were discussed,
      which they had neither minds nor means to enable them to carry out; in
      short, the place is one of those innocent sedition shops which act as
      safety valves to carry off popular discontent, and ensure the health and
      vigour of the British constitution. Of course, however, Grandeville did
      not see it in that point of view, and from that night forth he became
      positively rabid on the subject; so it entered the heads of some of us
      that we might improve the occasion by persuading him that he might,
      through me, communicate information to the Home Office (I need scarcely
      tell you that it never reached the authorities there), and we have led him
      on sweetly and easily, till he positively believes that he is to be at the
      Hall to-night as an accredited government agent, with full powers to
      suppress the meeting, and I know not what else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you&rsquo;ll get into a fearful row,&rdquo; urged Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are safe for a bit of a shindy, no doubt,&rdquo; was the cool reply; &ldquo;in
      fact I do not consider that the thing would go off properly without it, so
      I brought an Irishman with me to render it inevitable; but I have bribed a
      doorkeeper, and let the worst come to the worst, we can easily fight our
      way out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure we can,&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, &ldquo;lick a hundred such fellows as you
      have described. This is glorious fun; I would not have missed it for the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bracy glanced at him for a moment with a look of intense approval, then
      shaking him warmly by the hand, he said, &ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m delighted to make your
      acquaintance; your sentiments do you honour, sir. Are you much accustomed
      to rows of this nature, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been resident in Germany for the last three years,&rdquo; was the reply;
      &ldquo;and although they have a very fair notion of an <i>émeute</i> after their
      own fashion, they don&rsquo;t understand the use of the fist as we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two grand rules for crowd-fighting,&rdquo; returned Bracy. &ldquo;First,
      make play with your elbows, Cockneys&rsquo; ribs are as sensitive as niggers&rsquo;
      shins; secondly, if it comes to blows, strike at their faces, and never
      waste your strength; but when you <i>do</i> make a hit, drop your man if
      possible; it settles him, and frightens the rest. Here we are!&rdquo; So saying,
      he turned into a kind of passage which led to an open door, through which
      they passed into the body of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large room with a vaulted ceiling, and appeared capable of
      holding from five to six hundred persons. At the farther end of it was a
      platform, raised some feet, and divided from the rest of the hall by a
      stout wooden railing. The room was lighted with gas, and considerably more
      than half filled. Although the majority of the audience appeared to answer
      the description Bracy had given of them, yet along the sides of the
      apartment were ranged numbers of sturdy artisans and craftsmen, amongst
      whom many a stalwart form and stern determined visage might be detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some rather awkward customers here to-night,&rdquo; whispered
      Leicester. &ldquo;If we chance to get black eyes, Arundel, we must postpone our
      visit to the General to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that gives me a black eye shall have something to remember it by,
      at all events,&rdquo; returned Lewis quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! that fellow heard you,&rdquo; said Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis glanced in the direction indicated, and met the sinister gaze, of a
      tall, heavy-built mechanic, in a rough greatcoat, who frowned menacingly
      when he found that he was observed. Lewis smiled carelessly in reply, and
      proceeded after Bracy up the room. When he had passed, the man, still
      keeping his eye upon him, quitted his seat and followed at some little
      distance. On reaching the upper end of the room they perceived Grandeville
      and two or three others, among whom was McDermott, on the platform, while
      Frere and the rest of their party had congregated on and near a flight of
      five or six steps leading to it from the body of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Grandeville!&rdquo; observed Bracy, in an undertone, to Leicester. &ldquo;Do
      you mark that! he has secured a retreat&mdash;good generalship, very. I
      shall have to believe in him if he goes on as well as he has commenced.
      Hark! they are beginning to give tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he concluded, a little fat man came forward and said a good deal about
      the honour which had been done him in being allowed the privilege of
      opening the evening&rsquo;s proceedings, to which he appended a long and utterly
      incomprehensible account of the objects of the meeting. His zeal was
      evident, but Nature had never intended him for an orator, and the chances
      of life had fitted him with a short husky cough, so that nobody was very
      sorry when he ceded the rostrum to his &ldquo;esteemed friend, if he might be
      allowed to say so (which he was), Jabez Broadcom.&rdquo; This Jabez Broadcom was
      evidently a great gun, and his coming forward created no small sensation.
      He was a tall, gaunt-looking man, with straight weak hair and an unhealthy
      complexion; but his great feature, in every sense of the word, was his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <i>was</i> a mouth, not only for mutton, but for every other purpose to
      which that useful aperture could be applied; at present it was to be
      devoted to the task of conveying its owner&rsquo;s mighty thoughts, in
      appropriate language, to the eager listeners who surrounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman then, having, by dint of drawing in his lips and thrusting
      them out again, and rolling his eyes so fearfully as to suggest a sudden
      attack of English cholera, got up his steam to the required height,
      proceeded to inform the assembly that they were, individually and
      collectively, free and enlightened citizens of the great metropolis of
      Europe, prepared to recognise their sacred rights, and resolved to go
      forth as one man to assert and maintain them. Having imparted this
      information (through his nose, for the greater effect), he began to ask
      himself a species of Pinnock&rsquo;s Catechism, so to speak, which ran somewhat
      after the following fashion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why am I here to-night? Because I love profit? No. Because I love
      personal distinction? No. Because I love my country? Yes. Because I would
      not see her children slaves? Yes. Because purse-proud oppressors,
      revelling in their wealth, trample on the honest poor man? Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having said by heart several pages of this, in which he was exceedingly
      well up, and which he rattled off most fluently, he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But such tyranny shall not always be tolerated. British freemen, whose
      proud boast it is that they have never borne a foreign yoke, shall no
      longer crouch beneath a despotic rule at home. The atrocious barbarities
      of a brutal poor-law, which taxes honest householders to furnish salaried
      ruffians with power to drag the half-eaten crust from the famished jaws of
      helpless poverty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (A slight sensation was here occasioned by McDermott mentioning for the
      benefit of the meeting in general, and the orator himself in particular,
      his conviction that the last sentence was &ldquo;very pretty indeed,&rdquo; together
      with a polite inquiry as to whether he could not be so kind as to say it
      again. Peace being restored after sundry shouts of &ldquo;Turn him out!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; etc., the orator resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them build their bastiles, let them tear the wife from her husband,
      the mother from her child; let them crowd their prison-houses with the
      honest sons of labour whom their brutality has forced into crime&mdash;the
      poor man need never dread starvation while the hulks hunger and the
      gallows gapes for him&mdash;but a day of retribution is at hand; let the
      tyrants tremble beneath their gilded roofs&mdash;those unjust usurpers of
      the soil&mdash;the poor man&rsquo;s bitterest foes, the landed gentry, as they
      arrogantly style themselves, must be cut off and rooted out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty strong, that!&rdquo; observed Bracy, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;this won&rsquo;t do, you know!&rdquo; returned Grandeville, in an equally
      low voice. &ldquo;I must, really&mdash;ar&mdash;interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better hear him out,&rdquo; rejoined Bracy, &ldquo;and then get up and address them
      yourself.&rdquo; To which suggestion, after a slight remonstrance, the former
      agreed; but such a shining light as Mr. Jabez Broadcom was not to be put
      out as quickly as they desired; he was the great card of the evening, and
      knew it, and prolonged his speech for a good three-quarters of an hour,
      during which time he theoretically dethroned the Queen, abolished the
      Lords and Commons, seated a National Convention in St. Stephen&rsquo;s, and made
      all the rich poor, and the poor both rich and happy, whilst he practically
      rendered himself so hoarse as to be nearly inaudible; for which gallant
      exertions in the cause of liberty he received the tumultuous applause of
      the meeting, together with Lieut. McDermott&rsquo;s expressed conviction that he
      was &ldquo;a broth of a boy entirely,&rdquo; together with an anxious inquiry,
      &ldquo;whether his mother had many more like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Broadcom retired from the rostrum there appeared some
      misunderstanding and confusion as to his successor; taking advantage of
      which, Grandeville looked at Bracy, who nodded, adding, &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your time!
      Go in, and win;&rdquo; then, catching a cadaverous-looking individual who was
      about to advance by the shoulders, and twisting him round, he exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Now, my man, stand out of the way, will you? This gentleman is going to
      address the company.&rdquo; He next thrust Grandeville forward, and patting him
      encouragingly on the back, left him to his own devices. That heroic
      gentleman, having bowed to his audience with much grace and dignity, waved
      his hand to command attention, and began as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;listen to me, my friends! Ar&mdash;hem&mdash;I am prepared to
      admit&mdash;that is, it is impossible to deny&mdash;that many great and
      serious evils exist in the complicated social fabric of this glorious
      country. The vast increase of population&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owing to the introduction of chloroform,&rdquo; suggested Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though slightly checked by&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The alarming consumption of Morrison&rsquo;s Pills,&rdquo; interposed the Irishman&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wise facilities afforded for emigration,&rdquo; continued Grandeville, not
      heeding these interruptions, &ldquo;is one chief cause of the poverty and
      distress which, though greatly exaggerated by the false statements of
      evil-disposed and designing persons (groans and cries of &lsquo;Hear!&rsquo;), are to
      be found even in this metropolis, beneath the fostering care of an
      enlightened and paternal government (increasing murmurs of
      dissatisfaction). But if you believe that these evils are likely to be
      redressed by such measures as have been pointed out to you this evening,
      or that anarchy and rebellion can lead to any other result than misery and
      ruin&mdash;ar&mdash;I tell you, that you are fearfully mistaken! Ar&mdash;as
      a man, possessed of&mdash;ar&mdash;no inconsiderable influence&mdash;and
      ar&mdash;intimately connected with those powers against which you are
      madly arraying yourselves, I warn you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the excitement and dissatisfaction, which had been rapidly
      increasing, reached a pitch which threatened to render the speaker
      inaudible; and amid cries of &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;an informer!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;government
      spy!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;turn him out!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;throw him over!&rdquo; several persons rose
      from their seats and attempted to force their way on to the platform, but
      were kept back by Lewis and others of Grandeville&rsquo;s party, who, as has
      been already mentioned, had taken possession of the flight of steps, which
      afforded the only legitimate means of access from the body of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undisturbed by these hostile demonstrations, Grandeville continued, at the
      top of his voice,&mdash;&ldquo;I warn you that you are provoking an unequal
      struggle,&mdash;that you are bringing upon yourselves a fearful
      retribution. Even now I am armed with authority to disperse this meeting&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What more he would have added the reader is not fated to learn, for at
      this moment the man in the rough greatcoat, who had followed Lewis from
      the entrance of the room, exclaiming, &ldquo;Come on, we are not going to stand
      this, you know; never mind the steps,&rdquo; seized the railing of the platform,
      and drawing himself up, sprang over, followed by several others. In an
      instant all was confusion. Grandeville, taken in some degree by surprise,
      after knocking down a couple of his assailants, was overpowered, and, amid
      cries of &ldquo;throw him over,&rdquo; hurried to the edge of the platform; here,
      grasping the rail with both hands, he struggled violently to prevent the
      accomplishment of their purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, boys! we must rescue him,&rdquo; exclaimed Bracy; and suiting the
      action to the word, he bounded forward, and hitting right and left,
      reached the scene of conflict. Lewis and the others, abandoning the steps,
      followed his example, and the row became general. For some minutes the
      uproar was terrific; blows were given and received; blood began to flow
      from sundry noses; and certain eyes that had begun the evening blue,
      brown, or grey, as the case might be, assumed a hue dark as Erebus. As for
      Lewis, he knocked down one of the fellows who had hold of Grandeville;
      then he picked up the Irishman, who of course had singled out and attacked
      the biggest man in the crowd (none other indeed than the rough-coated
      patriot, who appeared a sort of leader among them), and been immediately
      felled by him to the ground; then he assisted Frere in extricating the
      pale-faced youth from three individuals of questionable honesty, who were
      availing themselves of the confusion to empty his pockets; as he did so he
      felt himself seized with a grasp of iron, and turning his head, found he
      was collared by the gigantic leader. A violent but ineffectual effort to
      free himself only served to convince him that in point of strength he was
      no match for his antagonist, who, regarding him with a smile of gratified
      malice, exclaimed, &ldquo;Now then, young feller, I&rsquo;ve been a-waiting to get
      hold of you. How about a black eye now?&rdquo; As he spoke he drew him forward
      with one hand and struck at him savagely with the other. Avoiding the blow
      by suddenly dodging aside, Lewis closed with his adversary, and inserting
      his knuckles within the folds of his neckcloth, tightened it, until in
      self-defence, and in order to avoid strangulation, the fellow was forced
      to loosen his grasp of Lewis&rsquo;s collar. The instant he felt himself free,
      Lewis, giving the neckcloth a final twist, and at the same time pressing
      his knuckles into the man&rsquo;s throat, so as for the moment almost to
      throttle him, stepped back a couple of paces, and springing forward again
      before the other had time to recover himself, hit up under his guard and
      succeeded in planting a stinging and well-directed blow exactly between
      his eyes; this, followed by a similar application rather lower on the
      face, settled the matter. Reeling backwards, his antagonist lost his
      footing and fell heavily to the ground, dragging one of his companions
      down with him in a futile attempt to save himself. The fall of their
      leader threw a damp on the spirits of the others; and although those in
      the rear were still clamorous with threats and vociferations, the members
      of the crowd in more immediate proximity to the little party showed small
      inclination to renew the attack.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our time for getting away,&rdquo; said Bracy. &ldquo;Make a bold push for the
      door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;I should say,&rdquo; rejoined Grandeville, one of whose eyes was
      completely closed from the effects of a blow, and whose coat was hanging
      about him in ribands, &ldquo;let us despatch one of our party for the police and
      military, and stand firm and maintain our ground till they come up, then
      capture the ringleaders and clear the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Leicester, who, despite his regard for his wardrobe, had
      behaved most spiritedly during the skirmish. &ldquo;We shall all be murdered
      before they appear; besides&rdquo; (he added aside to Bracy), &ldquo;it will be making
      much too serious a business of it; we should get into some tremendous
      scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Bracy; then turning to Grandeville, he added, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think my instructions would bear us out if we were to go any
      further. Remember, we were only to make a pacific demonstration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And faith, if breaking heads, and getting a return in kind, comes under
      that same denomination, it&rsquo;s a pretty decent one we&rsquo;ve made already, &rsquo;pon
      me conscience,&rdquo; put in McDermott, wiping away the blood that was still
      trickling from a cut in his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these remarks were bandied from one to another, the party had
      contrived to make their way from the platform, and were now in the body of
      the room, striving to push through the crowd towards the side door. This
      at every step became more and more difficult, till at length they were so
      completely hemmed in that further progression became impossible, and it
      was evident that a fresh attack upon them was meditated. Fortunately,
      however, they were not far from the point of egress, and Bracy, having
      caught the eye of his ally the doorkeeper, who was on the alert,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Now, Grandeville, we must fight our way through these fellows
      and gain the door; there&rsquo;s nothing for it but a spirited charge. You and
      I, Frere and his friend, and Paddy had better go first as a sort of
      wedge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;head the column and break the enemy&rsquo;s ranks, ar&mdash;yes, are
      you all ready? Charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he gave the word they rushed forward in a compact body, and knocking
      down and pushing aside all who opposed them, succeeded in reaching the
      door. Here a short delay occurred while Bracy and his friend were opening
      it, and several of their late antagonists, irritated at the prospect of
      their escape, incited the others to attack them, so that before their
      egress was secured even the Irish lieutenant had had fighting enough to
      satisfy him, and the pale young man, having long since given himself up as
      a lost mutton, actually fainted with fear and over-exertion, and was
      dragged from under the feet of the combatants and carried out by Frere and
      Lewis, but for whom his mortal career would then and there have ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, as they emerged into the street, a party of the police arrived and
      caused more confusion and more broken heads; and how Grande-ville and the
      Irishman on the one hand, and sundry Chartists, with Lewis&rsquo;s late
      antagonist among them, on the other, were jointly and severally taken into
      custody and marched to the station-house, where they spent the night; and
      how Leicester contrived just in the nick of time to catch an intelligent
      cab, into which he, Lewis, Frere, and the fainting victim with the pallid
      physiognomy compressed themselves, and were conveyed rapidly from the
      scene of action, it boots not to relate: suffice it to say that a certain
      barrel of oysters, flanked by a detachment of pint bottles of stout, which
      had taken up their position on Frere&rsquo;s dining-table during the absence of
      its master, sustained an attack about half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock that night
      which proved that the mode in which their assailants had passed the
      evening had in no way impaired their respective appetites.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;IN WHICH LEWIS ARUNDEL SKETCHES A COW, AND THE AUTHOR
      DRAWS A YOUNG LADY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was about noon
      on the day following the events narrated in the last chapter. Frere had
      departed to his office at the scientific institution some two hours since,
      and Lewis and Faust were looking out of the window, when a well-appointed
      cab dashed round the corner of a cross street, and a pair of
      lavender-coloured kid-gloves drew up a splendid bay horse, who arched his
      proud neck and champed the bit, impatient of delay, till a young male
      child in livery coat and top-boots rolled off the back of the vehicle and
      stationed itself before the animal&rsquo;s nose, which act of self-devotion
      appeared to mesmerise him into tranquillity, and afforded the occupant of
      the cab time to spring out and knock at Frere&rsquo;s door. Five minutes more
      saw Leicester and Lewis seated side by side and driving rapidly in the
      direction of Park Crescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you feel this morning, Arundel,&rdquo; began Leicester; &ldquo;but
      positively when I first woke I could scarcely move. I&rsquo;m black and blue all
      over, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess to being rather stiff,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and my left hand
      is unproducible. I cut my knuckles against the nose of that tall fellow
      when I knocked him down, and shall be forced to wear a glove till it
      heals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did that uncommonly well,&rdquo; returned Leicester; &ldquo;the man was as strong
      as Hercules, and vicious into the bargain. He evidently had heard what you
      said about a black eye, and meant mischief. I was coming to help you when
      you finished him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been most provoking to have been disfigured just at this
      time,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis. &ldquo;One could not very well go to propose oneself as a
      mentor for youth with a black eye obtained in something nearly akin to a
      street row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Leicester; &ldquo;the General would consider our last night&rsquo;s exploit
      as dreadfully <i>infra dig.</i> He is quite one of the old school, and
      reckons Sir Charles Grandison a model for gentlemen. You must be careful
      to avoid the free-and-easy style of the present day with him; but I think
      you&rsquo;ll suit him exactly; there&rsquo;s naturally something of the <i>preux
      chevalier, héros de roman</i> cut about you that will go down with him
      amazingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In plain English, you consider me stiff and affected,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
      &ldquo;Do not scruple to tell me if it is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stiff, yes; affected, no,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;Indeed, your manner is
      unusually simple and natural when you thaw a little, but at first you are&mdash;well,
      I hardly know how to describe it; but there is something about you unlike
      the men one usually meets. You have a sort of half-defiant way of looking
      at people, a sort of &lsquo;you&rsquo;d better not insult me, sir&rsquo; expression. I don&rsquo;t
      know that I should have observed it towards myself, but it was your manner
      to Grandeville that particularly struck me. I have not annoyed you by my
      frankness?&rdquo; he added interrogatively, finding that Lewis did not reply.
      Regardless of this question, Lewis remained silent for a minute or two,
      then suddenly turning to his companion, and speaking in a low, hurried
      voice, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you conceive no reason for such a manner? Is there not enough in my
      position to account for that, ay, and more? By birth I am any man&rsquo;s equal.
      My father was of an old family, a captain in the Austrian service, and in
      the highest sense of the word a gentleman. I have received a gentleman&rsquo;s
      education. Up to the present time I have associated with gentlemen on
      terms of equality, and now suddenly, through no fault of my own, I am in
      effect a beggar. The very errand we are upon proves it. Through the
      kindness of Frere and of yourself,&mdash;a stranger,&mdash;I am about to
      receive a favourable recommendation to some proud old man as a hired
      servant; for though in name it may not be so, in fact I shall be nought
      but a hireling! Is it strange then that I view men with suspicion? that I
      am watchful lest they attempt to refuse me the amount of courtesy due to
      those who, having never forfeited their own self-respect, are entitled to
      the respect of others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and removing his hat, allowed the cold breeze to blow freely
      around his heated brow. Leicester, who, despite his foppery, was
      thoroughly kind-hearted, being equally surprised and distressed at the
      burst of feeling his words had called forth, hastened to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I really am&mdash;that is, &rsquo;pon my word, I had no
      idea you looked upon the affair in this light. I can assure you, I think
      you quite mistake the matter; a tutorship is considered a very gentlemanly
      occupation. If I had any work in me, I&rsquo;m not at all sure I might not&mdash;that
      is, it would be a very sensible thing of me to look out for something of
      the kind myself. Stanhope Jones, who was up at Trinity with me, and about
      the fastest man of his year, ran through his fortune, got a tutorship in
      Lord Puzzletête&rsquo;s family, went abroad with the eldest cub, and picked up a
      prize widow at Pisa, with tin enough to set the leaning tower straight
      again, if she&rsquo;d had a fancy to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this well-meant attempt at consolation Lewis had had time to come
      to the conclusion that he was in the position of that unwise individual
      who wore &ldquo;his heart upon his sleeve for daws to peck at;&rdquo; or, in plain
      English, that he had been betrayed into a display of feeling before a man
      incapable of appreciating or understanding it; and a less agreeable
      conviction at which to arrive we scarcely know. Nothing, however, remained
      but to make the best of it, which he accordingly did, by admitting the
      possibility that there might be much truth in Leicester&rsquo;s view of the
      case, and changing the subject by saying, &ldquo;Now I want you to give me a
      peep at the <i>carte du pays</i> of the unknown region I am about to
      explore. I think I pretty well comprehend the General from your
      description. Of what other members does the family consist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, of course you must be curious to know. Well, the <i>dramatis
      persono</i> is somewhat limited. First and foremost, the General,&mdash;you
      comprehend him, you say?&rdquo; Lewis made a sign in the affirmative, and
      Leicester continued: &ldquo;Then we have an awful personage, who I expect will
      be a severe trial to you&mdash;Miss Livingstone; she is a relation, an
      aunt I think, of the General&rsquo;s late wife, who lives with him and keeps his
      house, and was the terror of my boyhood whenever I was staying down at
      Broadhurst. She never was over young, I believe; at least I can&rsquo;t imagine
      her anything but middle-aged, and she must now be sixty or thereabouts.
      For the rest, she looks as if she had swallowed a poker, and, by some
      mysterious process of assimilation, become imbued with its distinguishing
      characteristics; for she is very stiff, very cold, and as far as I know
      utterly impenetrable, but of a stirring disposition withal, which leads
      her to interfere with everybody and everything. Lastly, there is my cousin
      Annie, the General&rsquo;s only daughter; she inherits her mother&rsquo;s beauty, her
      father&rsquo;s pride, her great-aunt&rsquo;s determination to have her own way, and
      the devil&rsquo;s own love of teasing. To set against all this, I believe her to
      be thoroughly good and amiable, and everything of that kind; at all events
      she is a most bewitching girl, and bids fair, under judicious management,
      to become a very charming woman! fancy her mission is to reform my brother
      Bellefield and render him a steady married man, and I wish her joy of it.
      She comes into her mother&rsquo;s fortune when she is of age, and the respective
      governors have set their hearts upon the match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what says Lord Bellefield?&rdquo; inquired Lewis listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bell reckons she won&rsquo;t be of age, and that the match can&rsquo;t come off
      these four years, by which time he expects to be so hard up that he must
      marry somebody; and as there will be plenty of the needful, she will suit
      his book as well as any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady, of course, approves?&rdquo; continued Lewis dreamily, untying a
      knot in the thong of Leicester&rsquo;s whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch a woman refusing a coronet,&rdquo; returned Leicester, as he pulled up at
      a house in Park Crescent so suddenly as almost to throw the bay on his
      haunches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Grant begs you will walk upstairs, Mr. Leicester. He is engaged
      at present, but desired me to say he particularly wishes to see you,&rdquo; was
      the reply made by a most aristocratic butler to Leicester&rsquo;s inquiry
      whether his master was at home. &ldquo;Keep the bay moving, Tim. Now, Arundel,
      turn to the right&mdash;that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; and suiting the action to the word,
      Charley the indolent leisurely descended from the cab, and crossing the
      &ldquo;marble hall,&rdquo; lounged up a wide staircase followed by Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence and solitude,&rdquo; he continued, opening the door of a large
      drawing-room handsomely furnished. &ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t be long before they
      introduce us to the luncheon-table. Oysters are popularly supposed to give
      one an appetite; but the natives we demolished at Frere&rsquo;s last night must
      have been sadly degenerate, for I declare to you I could scarcely get
      through my breakfast this morning. Ah! what have we here?&mdash;a
      water-colour landscape in a semi-chaotic condition. Annie has been
      sketching, as sure as fate. I&rsquo;ll introduce a few masterly touches and
      surprise her.&rdquo; So saying he seated himself at the table and began dabbling
      with a brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, I&rsquo;ve done it now!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a tone of consternation,
      after a minute&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;Just look here; I thought I would insert the
      trunk of a tree in the foreground, and the confounded brush had got red in
      it, so I have made a thing like a lobster and spoiled the drawing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, if you wish, I could turn it into a cow, and so get you out of
      the scrape,&rdquo; suggested Lewis, smiling at his companion&rsquo;s guilty
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, the very thing,&rdquo; exclaimed Leicester, hastily rising and
      thrusting Lewis into his seat; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a cow, by all means. That&rsquo;s
      famous,&rdquo; he continued, as with a few graphic strokes Lewis converted the
      red daub into the semblance of an animal. &ldquo;Bravo! make her an eye&mdash;now
      the horns&mdash;what a fascinating quadruped! Where&rsquo;s the tail to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not see the tail in the position in which the cow is supposed
      to be lying,&rdquo; remonstrated Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, it would make it more natural,&rdquo; urged Leicester. &ldquo;As a personal
      favour, just to oblige me, stretch a point and give her a tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, then, I&rsquo;ve twisted it under her leg,&rdquo; said Lewis, making the
      desired addition; &ldquo;but depend upon it, there never was a cow&rsquo;s tail so
      situated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the greater proof of your talent,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The ideal is what
      you artists (for I see you are one) are always raving about, and this is a
      specimen of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So engrossed had the two young men been with their occupation that they
      had not observed the entrance of a third person. The newcomer was that
      most charming of all created beings, a very lovely girl of seventeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As every poet since Homer has done his utmost to clothe in fitting
      language a description of the best specimen of the class which it may have
      been his hap to meet with, and as no man in his senses would exchange
      half-an-hour of the society of one of the originals for all the fanciful
      descriptions of women that ever were written, we would fain be excused
      from adding one more to the number; and were all our readers of what
      grammarians most ungallantly term &ldquo;the worthier gender,&rdquo; we should cut the
      matter short by begging each man to imagine the damsel in question exactly
      like the &ldquo;unexpressive she&rdquo; who is, for the time being, queen of his soul.
      But as we flatter ourselves certain bright eyes will sparkle and coral
      lips smile over this &ldquo;o&rsquo;er true tale,&rdquo; and as we have already been asked
      by &ldquo;oceans&rdquo; of young ladies, &ldquo;What is the heroine to be like?&rdquo; we will
      e&rsquo;en make a virtue of necessity and give a <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of
      her many perfections.

      Annie Grant, then (for we&rsquo;ll have no disguise about the matter, but own at
      once that she it <i>was</i> who entered the drawing-room unperceived, and
      that she it <i>is</i> who is destined to play the heroine in this our
      drama of the Railroad of Life; and be it observed interparenthetically
      that we use the theatrical metaphor advisedly, for Shakespeare has told us
      that &ldquo;all the world&rsquo;s a stage,&rdquo; and it is a matter of common notoriety
      that in the present day all stages have become railroads)&mdash;Annie
      Grant, then, we say, was rather above the middle height, though no one
      would have thought of pronouncing her tall; her gown of <i>mousseline&mdash;poil
      de</i>&mdash;psha! what are we thinking of?&mdash;she had not a gown on at
      all; how should she, when she was going to ride directly after luncheon?
      No, her habit, which fitted to perfection, was well calculated to set off
      her slight but singularly graceful figure to the best advantage. Her hair,
      which was braided in broad plaits for the greater convenience (seeing that
      ringlets under a riding-hat are an anomaly, not to say an abomination),
      was <i>really</i> auburn,&mdash;by which definition we intend to guard
      against the pale red, or warm, sand-coloured locks which usually pass
      current for the very rare but very beautiful tint we would particularise,&mdash;and
      if a poet had speculated as to the probability of some wandering sunbeam
      being imprisoned in its golden meshes, the metaphor, though fanciful,
      would not have been unapt. Delicate, regular features, large blue eyes,
      now dancing and sparkling with mischievous glee, now flashing with pride,
      a mouth like an expressive rosebud, a clear skin, with a warm glow of
      health painting each velvet cheek, but retreating from the snowy forehead,
      combined to form a whole on which to gaze was to admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young lady, being such as we have described her, tripped lightly
      across the apartment till she had stationed herself behind her cousin
      Charles, and perceiving that both gentlemen were so preoccupied as not to
      have observed her approach, contrived, by standing on tiptoe and peeping
      over Leicester&rsquo;s shoulder, to witness the introduction of the cow of which
      we have already made honourable mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the animated discussion on the tail question she nearly betrayed
      her presence by laughing outright; repressing the inclination, however,
      she retraced her steps, and had nearly succeeded in reaching the side door
      by which she had entered, when her habit, catching against a table, caused
      the overthrow of a piece of ornamental china and revealed her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the sound, Lewis, recalled to a sense of his situation, and for
      the first time struck by the idea that, in touching the drawing, he had
      been guilty of an unwarrantable liberty, rose hastily from his seat,
      colouring crimson as he did so, from an agreeable mixture of shyness,
      mortification, and proud self-reproach. Leicester, on the other hand, with
      the <i>à-plomb</i> and presence of mind of a man of the world, turned
      leisurely, and whispering, &ldquo;Keep your own counsel, there&rsquo;s no harm done,&rdquo;
       he advanced towards his cousin, saying with a nonchalant air, &ldquo;You have
      stolen a march upon us, Annie. This gentleman and I called to see the
      General upon business, and as he seems resolved to afford us a practical
      lesson on the virtue of patience. I ventured to while away the time by
      showing my friend some of your sketches. By the way, let me introduce you.
      My cousin, Miss Grant&mdash;Mr. Arundel.&rdquo; Thus invoked, Lewis, who in
      order to atone to his wounded self-respect, had wrapped himself in his
      very coldest and haughtiest manner, and resembled a banished prince rather
      than an every-day Christian, advanced a few steps and acknowledged the
      introduction by a most Grandisonian inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady performed her part of the ceremony with an easy courtesy, into
      which perhaps an equal degree of hauteur was infused, although not the
      slightest effort was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arundel is doubtless a judge of painting, and my poor sketches are by
      no means calculated to bear severe criticism,&rdquo; remarked Miss Grant
      demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis remained silent, Leicester hastened to reply: &ldquo;A judge! of course
      he is; he&rsquo;s just returned from Germany, the happy land where smoking,
      singing, and painting all come by nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; returned Miss Grant. &ldquo;Then, if it is not too troublesome,
      perhaps I might ask Mr. Arundel&rsquo;s advice as to a sketch of Broadhurst I
      was attempting before your arrival; I left off in despair, because I could
      not manage anything for the foreground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try an elephant,&rdquo; suggested Leicester; &ldquo;it would have a grand effect,
      besides possessing the advantage of novelty, and filling up lots of
      space.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you bring me the drawing, Charles?&rdquo; returned his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know too well the style of assistance I may expect from you in such
      matters. Who embellished my poor head of Minerva with a pair of <i>moustaches?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; rejoined Leicester complacently, &ldquo;and I am proud of it. Minerva
      was the goddess of war, and sported <i>moustaches</i> in virtue of her
      profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you never going to give me the drawing, Charles?&rdquo; asked Annie
      impatiently. &ldquo;Positively, cousins are most uncourteous beings. Mr.
      Arundel, might I trouble you to hand me that sketch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, Lewis had nothing for it but to comply, which he did
      accordingly, biting his lip with vexation at the <i>dénouement</i> which
      now appeared inevitable. But Leicester&rsquo;s resources were not yet exhausted;
      stretching out his hand before his cousin had received the drawing, he
      coolly took possession of it, saying, &ldquo;I know you meant this drawing as a
      little surprise for me. You have heard me say how much I coveted a sketch
      of dear old Broadhurst, and so you have kindly made one for me. You have
      really done it extremely well! Who was it&mdash;Fielding&mdash;you have
      been learning of? Positively, you have caught his style!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself that I did you the honour of recollecting any such
      wish, even supposing you really uttered it in my hearing, of which I
      entertain grave doubts,&rdquo; returned Annie; &ldquo;but if you particularly desire
      it I will make you a present of it when it is finished&mdash;if I could
      only manage that tiresome foreground!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it better without,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to interfere
      with the outline of the building, which stands forth in bold relief&mdash;and&mdash;eh!&mdash;well,
      what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During his speech his cousin had risen from her seat, and approaching him,
      caught sight of the drawing, which she had no sooner done than, raising a
      little white hand, she pointed to the intrusive cow and asked quietly,
      &ldquo;Where did that come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The comic perplexity of Leicester&rsquo;s face was irresistible to behold, as,
      with a glance at Lewis to secure his sympathy and co-operation, he was
      evidently about to adopt the cow at all hazards, when the door opened, and
      a tall, stately old man, with a military port and erect bearing, entered,
      and surveying the group with evident surprise, drew himself up still more
      stiffly, ere, with slow and measured steps, he advanced towards them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;WHEREIN THE READER IS INTRODUCED TO MISS LIVINGSTONE,
      AND INFORMED WHO IS THE GREATEST MAN OF THE AGE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;A</span>h! General,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Leicester, as he rose leisurely from the arm-chair in which he
      had been reclining, &ldquo;I hope they have not disturbed you on our account. I
      was criticising one of Annie&rsquo;s sketches <i>pour passer le temps</i>&mdash;really
      she draws very nicely. Let me introduce Mr. Arundel, Mr. Frere&rsquo;s friend,
      about whom I wrote to you yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stiff bow, acknowledged on Lewis&rsquo;s part by an equally haughty
      inclination of the head, was the result of this introduction, when General
      Grant observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Frere is a man of whom I have a very high opinion, both on account of
      his unusual intellectual attainments, and his manly, upright character.
      Have you been long acquainted with him, sir, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my guide and protector when I first went to Westminster,&rdquo; replied
      Lewis, &ldquo;and we have been close friends ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most fortunate circumstance,&rdquo; remarked the General sententiously. &ldquo;The
      mind of youth is easily impressible for good or evil, and unless such
      establishments are greatly altered for the better since my time, Satan has
      no lack of emissaries at a public school. Will you allow me a few minutes&rsquo;
      private conversation with you, Mr. Arundel? The library is in this
      direction.&rdquo; So saying, General Grant opened the door with frigid courtesy,
      and signing to Lewis to precede him, followed with a stateliness of
      demeanour admirable to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had they left the room, when Annie, clapping her hands joyfully,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;What a creature! why, he&rsquo;s as stiff and dignified as papa
      himself. Now then, Charley, tell me who he is, and all about him: we shall
      have Aunt Martha or somebody coming, and then I shall never know, and be
      obliged to die of curiosity. You are asleep, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go&mdash;that&rsquo;s always the way with women,&rdquo; returned Leicester,
      speaking very slowly and with an exaggeration of his usual mode of
      pronunciation, which was something between a lisp and a drawl; &ldquo;asking
      half-a-dozen questions in a breath, and resolved to get up a suicidal
      amount of curiosity if they are not as speedily answered. Why, my dear
      child, I would not speak as quickly as you do for any amount of money&mdash;at
      least any amount of money I should be at all likely to get for doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Charley, don&rsquo;t be tiresome. Who is the man?&rdquo; rejoined Annie, half
      pettishly. Then, seeing that her imperious manner only induced her cousin
      still further to tease her, she added, in an imploring tone, which no
      heart of any material softer than granite could resist, &ldquo;You will tell me&mdash;won&rsquo;t
      you? I want to know so much, and I have had nothing to amuse me all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, do you hear that?&rdquo; soliloquised Leicester, appealing to society in
      general. &ldquo;Trust a woman to get her own way. If she can&rsquo;t scold you into
      giving it to her, she&rsquo;ll coax you. Well, you little torment, I suppose you
      must know all about it. The man, as you please to call him, is seeking the
      honourable post of bear-leader to the cub your father has the felicity of
      being guardian unto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, a tutor for poor Walter!&rdquo; rejoined Annie meditatively. &ldquo;But surely
      he&rsquo;s a gentleman, is he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very particularly and decidedly so, as far as I am a judge,&rdquo; returned
      Leicester, hooking a footstool towards him with his cane, and depositing
      his feet thereupon. &ldquo;At least I dined and spent last evening in his
      company, and never wish to meet a better fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Annie, pursuing her train of reasoning, &ldquo;if he is a
      gentleman, why does he want to go out as a tutor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, unfortunately, there is a vulgar prejudice extant in this
      feeble-minded country that the necessaries of life, such as bread and
      cheese, cigars, kid gloves, and the like, must be paid for&mdash;this
      requires money, whereof Arundel has little or none. Moreover, Richard
      Frere hinted at a mother and sister in the case, who likewise have to be
      supported.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a shade of deeper thought flitted across Annie&rsquo;s expressive
      features, and after a moment&rsquo;s pause she resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I understand his strange manner: he was mentally contrasting himself
      (he is evidently a proud man) and his position; it must indeed have been a
      struggle&mdash;and he does this for the sake of his mother and sister.
      Charley, do you know, I rather admire him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I dare say you do; he&rsquo;s a decidedly good-looking fellow for the
      style of man; there&rsquo;s a thoroughbred air about him, and he carries himself
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psha! I am not talking of his appearance: except that he is tall and
      dark, I scarcely know what he is like,&rdquo; returned Annie quickly. &ldquo;No! I
      mean that there is something fine in the idea of a proud mind submitting
      to degradations and indignities for the sake of those it loves; bearing
      with a martyr-spirit the thousand hourly annoyances&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
       Checking herself suddenly, as she perceived upon her cousin&rsquo;s face
      something nearly akin to a contemptuous smile, Annie continued, &ldquo;Charles,
      how stupid you are! I hate you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not possible,&rdquo; was the cool reply. &ldquo;Moreover, you have really no cause to
      do so. I assure you I was not exactly laughing at your sudden plunge into
      the sentimental; it was merely a notion which crossed my mind, that out of
      the thousand hourly annoyances by which poor Arundel is to be martyrised,
      some nine hundred and fifty would originate in the caprices of a certain
      young lady who shall be nameless. In the monotony of life amid the leafy
      shades of Broadhurst, even teasing a tutor may be deemed a new and
      interesting variety, as the botanists have it. Seriously, though, you can
      coax the General to let him teach you German.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And embellish my water-colour sketches by the insertion of occasional
      cows, with impossible tails made to order&mdash;eh, cousin Charley?&rdquo;
       returned Annie with an arch smile. &ldquo;Give me my drawing, sir, and let me
      look at the creature. How well he has done it! I know a cow at Broadhurst
      with just such a face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a world of speculation in the eye,&rdquo; rejoined Leicester
      carelessly, though he was slightly surprised at the extent of her
      information respecting the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; debate; &ldquo;the animal appears to be
      ruminating on the advisability of petitioning Parliament against the veal
      trade, or some other question of equal interest to the &lsquo;milky mothers of
      the herd.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Annie and her cousin thus gaily conversed, a very different scene
      was enacting in the library. During a short delay, occasioned by General
      Grant&rsquo;s being obliged to answer a note, Lewis had time to recollect
      himself, and to school the rebellious feelings which his conversation with
      Leicester and the other events of the morning had called into action. He
      thought of Rose and his mother, and of his determination that they at
      least should be spared all knowledge of the real evils of poverty; and
      this reflection was for the time sufficient to efface every selfish
      consideration. Bringing his strength of will into play, he regained the
      most complete self-control, and even experienced a sort of morbid pleasure
      in the idea of voluntarily humiliating himself before the proud old man,
      whose clear, cold eye was occasionally raised from the note he was
      employed in writing to fix its scrutinising glance on Lewis&rsquo;s features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having sealed the missive and given it to a servant, he slowly approached
      the spot where Lewis was standing, and after a word or two of apology for
      having kept him waiting, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume my nephew, Mr. Leicester, has made you in some degree
      acquainted with the nature of the circumstances in which I am at present
      placed, and of the necessity which renders me anxious to secure the
      services of some gentleman as tutor to my ward, Sir Walter Desborough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Leicester informed me that the young gentleman&rsquo;s education had been
      neglected, and that his mind was singularly undeveloped,&rdquo; replied Lewis,
      choosing the least offensive terms in which he might express his
      conviction that the youth in question was rather a fool than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, though it is even worse than you describe,&rdquo; returned the
      General. &ldquo;In fact it depends upon the degree of success which may attend
      the efforts which must now be made whether Sir Walter Desborough can ever
      be considered capable of managing his own affairs, or able to take that
      place in society to which his rank and fortune would naturally entitle
      him. You perceive, therefore, that the post of tutor will be one of much
      trust and importance, and the duties attending it most onerous. Mr. Frere
      has written so high a character of your various attainments that I cannot
      but feel perfectly satisfied of your competency; but you are very young,
      and as I should, in the event of your undertaking the charge, expect a
      strict performance of your duties, it is only fair to inform you that I
      conceive they may be irksome in the extreme. What is your feeling on the
      subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis paused for a moment in thought, and then replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be frank with you, sir. Were I free to act as I chose, such an
      office as you describe would be one of the last I should select; but the
      welfare of others depends upon my exertions, and I have determined to
      refuse no occupation not unworthy a gentleman which will enable me to
      render the necessary assistance to my family. If, therefore, you consider
      me fitted to undertake the charge of your ward, I am willing to do so, and
      to fulfil the duties of such a situation to the best of my ability, on one
      condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; inquired General Grant quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I may be allowed to pursue whatever system I may deem best fitted to
      attain the desired end, without the interference of any one, and may be
      accountable for my conduct to you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a singular request, young gentleman,&rdquo; returned the General,
      knitting his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reason for making it is easily explained, sir,&rdquo; replied Lewis, firmly
      but respectfully. &ldquo;Unless such permission is accorded me, I feel certain
      all my efforts would prove unavailing: I must have full power to do what I
      think right, or I could not act at all, and should have undertaken a duty
      which I should be incompetent to perform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, there is truth in what you say,&rdquo; replied General Grant, after
      a moment&rsquo;s consideration. &ldquo;I like you none the worse for speaking in a
      manly, straightforward manner. It is my intention to go down to Broadhurst
      in a day or two: you shall accompany me; and if, after seeing my ward, you
      are still willing to undertake the task of conducting his education, I
      shall be happy to entrust him to your care, upon the conditions you have
      proposed. Your salary will be £300 a year. This, you are aware, is
      unusually high, but the case is a peculiar one, and money, fortunately, a
      very secondary consideration. An entire suite of rooms will be devoted to
      the use of yourself and your pupil, and a horse kept for you, that you may
      accompany him in his rides. Do these arrangements meet your wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis bowed his head in token of acknowledgment, and said, &ldquo;I have one
      other request to make. I brought a Livonian wolf-hound with me from
      Germany; he is much attached to me, and I should be unwilling to part from
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him with you, sir,&rdquo; returned the General, his lip slightly curling
      with a sarcastic smile; &ldquo;a dog more or less will make little difference in
      such an establishment as that at Broadhurst. And now, if you will give me
      the pleasure of your company at luncheon, I shall be happy to introduce
      you to my relative, Miss Livingstone, who does me the honour to preside
      over my household. My daughter, I believe, you have already seen;&rdquo; and as
      he spoke he led the way to the dining-room, where the rest of the party
      were already assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Livingstone, who scrutinised Lewis as if she suspected him of
      belonging to that ingenious fraternity yclept the swell mob, was, in
      appearance, a very awful old lady indeed. The nearest approach we can make
      to a description of her features is to say that they bore a marked (with
      the small-pox) resemblance to those of Minerva <i>and</i> her owl; the
      sternness of that utilitarian goddess&mdash;the Miss Martineau of Olympus&mdash;and
      the sapient stupidity of the so-called bird of wisdom, finding their exact
      counterpart in Miss Livingstone&rsquo;s time-honoured physiognomy. This lady was
      appareled after a strange and imposing mode, as behoved a spinster of such
      orthodox station and ferociously virtuous propriety as the General&rsquo;s
      female commander-in-chief. Minerva&rsquo;s helmet was modernised into a
      stupendous fabric, wherein starch, muslin, and ribbon of an unnatural
      harshness struggled upwards in a pyramid, whence pointing with stiffened
      ends innumerable, suggestive of any amount of porcupines, they appeared
      ready and anxious to repel or impale society at large. A triangle of
      spotless lawn supplied the place of the breastplate beneath which Jove&rsquo;s
      daughter was accustomed to conceal her want of heart; and a silk gown of
      an uncomfortable shade of grey, made so scanty as to render at first sight
      the hypothesis of a mermaid<i>ic</i> termination conceivable, completed
      the costume of this immaculate old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having apparently satisfied herself that Lewis had no immediate design
      upon the spoons and forks, she condescended to afford him the
      meteorological information that although the sunshine might delude the
      unwary into believing it to be a fine day, she had received private
      information that the weather was not to be relied upon: after promulgating
      which opinion she placed herself at the head, and assumed the direction
      of, the luncheon-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley Leicester appeared to be the only individual of the party
      insensible to a certain freezing influence, which might be specified as
      one of Miss Livingstone&rsquo;s most characteristic attributes. Having exerted
      himself to supply that lady with every possible adjunct she could require,
      and seduced her into an amount of Cayenne pepper which afterwards
      subjected her to considerable physical suffering, he began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was present, a day or two ago, Miss Livingstone, when a question was
      started as to what man of modern times had been the greatest benefactor to
      his race. It opened a mine of very curious speculation, I can assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt it, Charles,&rdquo; returned Miss Livingstone; &ldquo;and I am glad to
      learn that the young men of the present day employ their time in such
      profitable discussions. What decision did you arrive at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; resumed Leicester gravely, &ldquo;there was of course much
      difference of opinion. James Watt had rather a strong party in his favour,
      but an ex-railway director was present who had lost £10,000 on the
      Do-em-and-Foot-in-it Line, and he blackballed him. Lord John was proposed;
      but some of the men who took in <i>Punch</i> laughed so immoderately when
      his name was mentioned that it was immediately withdrawn. One youth, who
      is known to be a little bit flighty, not quite accountable, poor fellow!
      declared for Lord Brougham, but we soothed him, and he had sense enough
      left to see his error almost immediately. At length it came to my turn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom did you mention?&rdquo; inquired Miss Livingstone, with a degree of
      interest most unusual in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had been pondering the matter deeply,&rdquo; continued Leicester, &ldquo;to try and
      hit on some worthy against whom no valid objection could be raised. At one
      moment I thought of Moses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancied it was restricted to men of modern times,&rdquo; interposed Miss
      Livingstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He to whom I referred, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; returned Leicester, &ldquo;was not the
      Israelitish lawgiver, but the man of the City Mart, that benevolent
      individual who clothes poverty in &lsquo;a light paletot at ten-and-six,&rsquo; and
      enables the honest hearts of free-born Britons to palpitate beneath a
      &lsquo;gent&rsquo;s superior vest&rsquo; for the trifling remuneration of five shillings.&rdquo;
       This speech was algebra, or thereabouts, to the lady to whom it was
      addressed, but she had a sort of instinctive apprehension that Leicester
      was talking nonsense, and accordingly drew herself up stiffly, completing
      her resemblance to Minerva by composing her features into a very
      satisfactory likeness of the Gorgon. No way affected by this
      transformation, Leicester continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On mature reflection, however, I discarded Moses &amp; Son, and was going
      to give it up as hopeless, when, all of a sudden, a bright thought flashed
      across me, and springing to my feet, I exclaimed in a voice of thunder,
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, I have it; the difficulty is one no longer: the greatest
      modern benefactor to the human race is&mdash;<i>Bass!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who?</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Livingstone, entirely mystified and a good
      deal flurried by the narrator&rsquo;s unusual energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bass,&rdquo; resumed Leicester; &ldquo;that remarkable man whose gigantic intellect
      first conceived the project of regenerating society through the medium of
      <i>pale ale!</i> The idea was hailed with enthusiasm; we immediately sent
      for a dozen; and ere the liquor was disposed of, there was not a man
      present but would have staked hundreds on the soundness of my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Utterly disgusted and confused by this unexpected termination to the
      anecdote, Miss Livingstone rose from her chair, sailed out of the room,
      and thus the visit concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, after a solitary walk, during which he was revolving in his mind
      the step he had just taken, and striving to discern in the dull
      lead-coloured horizon of his future one ray of light which might yield
      promise of brighter times to come, was ascending Frere&rsquo;s staircase, when
      the door of the room above opened suddenly, and a voice, which he thought
      he recognised, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may depend upon you; you&rsquo;ll be with me by eight at the latest, and
      bring your friend, if possible. Ah! here he is! Mr. Arundel, delighted to
      see you&mdash;none the worse for last night, I hope&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it
      glorious? Grandeville has got such a face on him, he won&rsquo;t be able to show
      for a week to come; and Meeking of the pallid features is so seedy this
      morning that I was forced to burthen my conscience by inventing a
      fictitious fall from his horse, on the strength of which I sent his mamma
      to nurse him. We must book that to the pious fraud account, and let the
      charity absolve the lie. Rather shaky divinity, eh, Frere? Well, <i>au
      revoir</i>; I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Mr. Tom Bracy&mdash;for he it was, and none other&mdash;dashed
      down the stairs, and having deeply scandalised Frere&rsquo;s ancient domestic by
      an anxious inquiry how it was she did not get a husband, took his
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frere!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, throwing himself into a chair and coldly
      repulsing Faust, who never could imagine himself otherwise than welcome,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I, man,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and pretty considerably brown, too, as
      that nice youth who has just left me would call it. But what have you done
      to make you so doleful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold myself,&rdquo; returned Lewis bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to the old gentleman, I hope,&rdquo; rejoined Frere, &ldquo;though your black
      looks would almost lead one to imagine so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What weak, inconsistent fools we are!&rdquo; pursued Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself, young man,&rdquo; observed Frere parenthetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How vacillating and impotent,&rdquo; continued Lewis, not heeding the
      interruption, &ldquo;is even the strongest will! I have done this morning the
      thing I believed I most anxiously desired to do&mdash;the thing I came
      here hoping to accomplish&mdash;I have secured a competence for my mother
      and sister. I have done so on better terms than I had deemed possible. I
      have met with consideration, if not kindness, from&mdash;from my
      employer.&rdquo; He pronounced the word firmly, though his temples throbbed and
      his lip quivered with suppressed emotion as he did so. &ldquo;All this should
      make me contented, if not happy. Happy!&rdquo; he repeated mockingly. &ldquo;Frere,&rdquo;
       he continued, with a sudden burst of impetuosity, &ldquo;it has not done so&mdash;I
      am miserable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his seat and began pacing the room with impatient strides.
      Faust followed him for one or two turns, wagging his tail and gazing up
      into his face with loving eyes; but finding his efforts to attract
      attention unavailing, he uttered a piteous whine, and, retreating to a
      corner, crouched down, as perfectly aware that his master was unhappy as
      if he had been a human creature and could have &ldquo;told his love&rdquo; in words.
      Frere would have spoken, but Lewis checked him by a gesture, and continued
      his rapid walk for some minutes in silence. At length he spoke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think me selfish and ungrateful, and you are right; I am so. I have
      schooled myself to bear all this, and I <i>will</i> bear it; but bitter
      thoughts arise and at times overpower me. I am very young&rdquo; (&ldquo;True for
      you,&rdquo; muttered Frere, <i>sotto voce</i>), &ldquo;and I am so unfit for such a
      life as lies before me, a life of tame and ceaseless drudgery, in which to
      indulge the high aspirations and noble daring that win men honour becomes
      misplaced folly; to live with people whose equal, if not superior, I feel
      myself, in a semi-menial capacity; to obey when I would command; to
      forfeit all that is bright and fair in existence&mdash;intercourse with
      the higher order of minds, the society of pure and refined spirits; and,
      above all, to lose the only thing I really prize on earth&mdash;my
      independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause, &ldquo;the die is cast, and repining is
      worse than useless. I will give this experiment a fair trial; it may be
      the harness will set more easily on me than I imagine; and should it
      become unbearable, I can but cast it off and start afresh: there is such a
      thing as to compel one&rsquo;s destiny!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;LEWIS RECEIVES A LECTURE AND A COLD BATH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ichard Frere
      listened to the somewhat grandiloquent remark with which the last chapter
      concluded, muttering to himself, &ldquo;&lsquo;Compel destiny,&rsquo; indeed; it strikes me
      you&rsquo;ll find &lsquo;destiny,&rsquo; as you call it, will have the best of it at that
      game;&rdquo; then turning to his companion, he observed more gravely, &ldquo;Now,
      listen to me, Lewis. What you have just said is no doubt true enough; you
      <i>are</i> about as unfit in tastes and habits for the life that is before
      you as a man well can be, but for that reason it is exactly the very best
      thing for you. For what purpose do you suppose we are sent into this
      world? Most assuredly not only to please ourselves, and by following out
      our own desires and caprices, create a sphere for the exercise and
      increase of our natural faults. No; the only true view of life is as a
      school, wherein our characters are to be disciplined, and all the changes
      and chances, sorrows, trials, and temptations we meet with are the agents
      by which the education of the soul is carried on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a low, wretched view of life it is,&rdquo; replied Lewis bitterly; &ldquo;a
      seventy years&rsquo; pupilage under the rod of destiny. The heathen sage was
      right who said that those whom the gods love die early. If it were not for
      Rose and my mother, I would join some regiment bound for India, volunteer
      into every forlorn hope, and trust that some Sikh bullet would rid me of
      the burthen of life without my incurring the guilt of suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, you would die like an idiot, because you lack moral courage to
      face the evils of life like a man,&rdquo; returned Frere. &ldquo;But wait a bit: your
      argument, such as it is, is founded on a fallacy, or on that still more
      dangerous thing, a half-truth. Granting that life were one scene of bitter
      experiences,&mdash;which would be granting a very large lie,&mdash;for
      what is this discipline intended to fit us? That is the question. You are
      ambitious&mdash;how would you regard obstacles in your path to greatness?
      You would rejoice in them, would you not, as opportunities for bringing
      out the high qualities you fancy you possess? fortitude, courage,
      indomitable perseverance, ready wit, aptitude to lead and govern your
      fellow-men, and fifty other magnanimous attributes; and deem the greatness
      unworthy your notice could it be obtained without a struggle. But what is
      human greatness? A triumph for the hour, bringing its attendant cares and
      evils with it&mdash;mark that,&mdash;a bauble, which some other ambitious
      genius may possibly wrest from your grasp, which old age would unfit you
      to retain, of which death must deprive you in a few years more or less.
      Now take the true, the Christian&rsquo;s view of life&mdash;obstacles to
      overcome, demanding all our strength of mind, and then proving too mighty
      for us without the assistance of a Power superior to that of man, but
      which will be given us if we seek it properly. And the victory won, what
      is the prize we shall obtain? A position, according to our advance in
      righteousness, among the spirits of just men <i>made perfect</i>
      intercourse (with reverence be it spoken) with the Source of all good,
      Omniscience our teacher, Omnipotence our only ruler, Perfect Justice our
      lawgiver, Perfect Wisdom our director, the Powers of Heaven for our
      associates, and our own souls, freed from the trammels of mortality,
      fitted to appreciate and enjoy these inestimable blessings; and all this,
      not for time, but for eternity. Lewis, you are a reasonable being, and to
      your own reason I will leave the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for some minutes. At length Lewis raised his head,
      revealing features on which the traces of deep emotion were visible, and
      stretching out his hand to his friend, said in a voice which trembled from
      excess of feeling, &ldquo;God bless you, Frere; you are indeed a true friend!&rdquo;
       He paused; then added suddenly, &ldquo;Frere, promise me one thing,&mdash;promise
      me that whatever I may do, whatever rash act or evil deed my feelings may
      hurry me into, you will not give me up; that while we both live you will
      act by me as you have done to-day&mdash;that you will preserve me from
      myself, stand between me and my fiery nature; then shall I feel that I am
      not utterly deserted&mdash;you will be the link that shall still bind me
      to virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you fancy it will make you any happier, or better, or more
      reasonable, I will promise it,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;more particularly as I
      should most probably do it whether I promise it or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promise, then?&rdquo; asked Lewis eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis once more wrung his friend&rsquo;s hand with such eagerness as to elicit a
      grimace of pain from that excellent individual, and then continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A conversation of this nature regularly upsets me; I must go out and walk
      off the excitement before I shall be fit for anything. Come, Faust, good
      dog! I spoke up for Faust to-day, Frere, and the General accorded a
      dignified assent: &lsquo;A dog more or less will make little difference in such
      an establishment as Broadhurst.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo; inquired Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Word for word,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought better things of him! &lsquo;Folks is sich fools!&rsquo; as my old
      lady downstairs says. Are you off? Mind you are at home in good time for
      dinner, for I have been seduced into accepting another evening engagement
      for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more fighting?&rdquo; asked Lewis anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; thank goodness for that same!&rdquo; returned Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could meet that long Chartist,&rdquo; continued Lewis, shaking his
      fist; &ldquo;not that I bear him any ill-will, but it would be such a relief to
      me just now to knock somebody down. Mayn&rsquo;t I set Faust at a policeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you prefer Brixton to Broadhurst, and the treadmill to the
      tutorship,&rdquo; returned Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye till dinner-time,&rdquo; responded Lewis, leaving the room. &ldquo;I
      won&rsquo;t punish your carpet any longer. Come, Faust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a most singular young man,&rdquo; soliloquised Frere as he took down
      and unrolled a Persian manuscript; &ldquo;very like an excitable steam-engine
      with an ill-regulated safety-valve in disposition; I only hope he won&rsquo;t
      blow up bodily while I have the care of him. He is a fine fellow, too, and
      it&rsquo;s impossible not to be very fond of him; but he&rsquo;s an awful
      responsibility for a quiet man to have thrust upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Lewis, walking hurriedly up one street and down another, with
      the design of allaying the fever of his mind by bodily exercise, found
      himself at length in the neighbourhood of Hyde Park, and, tempted by the
      beauty of the afternoon, he continued his stroll till he reached
      Kensington Gardens. Here, stretching himself on one of the benches, he
      watched the groups of gaily-dressed loungers and listened to the military
      band, till he began to fear he might be late for Frere&rsquo;s dinner; and
      retracing his steps, he proceeded along the bank of the Serpentine towards
      Hyde Park Corner. As he arrived nearly opposite the receiving-house of the
      Humane Society, his attention was attracted by the lamentations of a small
      child, whom all the endearments of a sympathising nursery-maid were
      powerless to console. The child, being a fine sturdy boy, and the maid
      remarkably pretty, Lewis was moved by a sudden impulse of compassion to
      stop and inquire the cause of the grief he beheld. It was soon explained.
      Master Tom had come to sail a little boat which his grandpapa had given
      him; the string by which the length of its voyage was to have been
      regulated had broken, and the boat had drifted farther and farther from
      its hapless owner, until at last it had reached a species of buoy, to
      which the park-keeper&rsquo;s punt was occasionally moored, and there it had
      chosen to stick hard and fast. In this rebellious little craft was
      embarked, so to speak, all Master Tom&rsquo;s present stock of earthly
      happiness; thence the sorrow which Mary&rsquo;s caresses were unable to assuage,
      and thence the lamentations which had attracted Lewis&rsquo;s attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry so, my little man, and we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t find a way of
      getting it for you,&rdquo; observed Lewis encouragingly, raising the distressed
      shipowner in his arms to afford him a better view of his stranded
      property. &ldquo;We must ask my dog to go and fetch it for us. Come here, Mr.
      Faust. You are not afraid of him? he won&rsquo;t hurt you&mdash;that&rsquo;s right,
      pat him; there&rsquo;s a brave boy; now ask him to fetch your boat for you. Say,
      &lsquo;Please, Mr. Faust, go and get me my boat!&rsquo; say so.&rdquo; And the child,
      half-pleased, half-frightened, but with implicit faith in the dog&rsquo;s
      intellectual powers, and the advisability of conciliating its good will
      and imploring its assistance, repeated the desired formula with great
      unction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well! Now, nurse, take care of Master&mdash;what did you say?&mdash;ay,
      Master Tom, while I show Faust where the boat is.&rdquo; As he spoke he took up
      a stone, and attracting Faust&rsquo;s attention to his proceedings, jerked it
      into the water just beyond the spot where the boat lay, at the same time
      directing him to fetch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a bound like the spring of a lion the noble dog dashed into the water
      and swam vigorously towards the object of his quest, reached it, seized it
      in his powerful jaws, and turned his head towards the bank in preparation
      for his homeward voyage, while the delighted child laughed and shouted
      with joy at the prospect of regaining his lost treasure. Instead, however,
      of proceeding at once towards the shore, the dog remained stationary,
      beating the water with his forepaws to keep himself afloat, and
      occasionally uttering an uneasy whine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Faust! Faust! what in the world&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; exclaimed
      Lewis, calling the dog and inciting him by gestures to return, but in
      vain; his struggles only became more violent, without his making the
      slightest progress through the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attracted by the sight, a knot of loungers gathered round the spot, and
      various suggestions were hazarded as to the dog&rsquo;s unaccountable behaviour.
      &ldquo;I think he must be seized with cramp,&rdquo; observed a good-natured,
      round-faced man in a velveteen jacket, who looked like one of the
      park-keepers. &ldquo;The animal is suicidally disposed, apparently,&rdquo; remarked a
      tall, aristocratic-looking young man, with a sinister expression of
      countenance, to which a pair of thick moustaches imparted a character of
      fierceness. &ldquo;Anxious to submit to the cold-water cure, more probably,&rdquo;
       remarked his companion. &ldquo;It will be kill rather than cure with him before
      long,&rdquo; returned the former speaker with a half laugh; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s getting lower
      in the water every minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is caught by the string of the boat which is twisted round the buoy!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Lewis, who during the above conversation had seized the branch
      of a tree, and raising himself by his hands, had reached a position from
      which he was able to perceive the cause of his favourite&rsquo;s disaster;
      &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be drowned if he is not unfastened. Who knows where the key of the
      boat-house is kept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run and fetch it,&rdquo; cried the good-natured man; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s at the
      receiving-house, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! or it will be of no use!&rdquo; said Lewis in the greatest excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hurried off, but the crowd round the spot had now become so dense&mdash;even
      carriages filled with fashionably-dressed ladies having stopped to learn
      the catastrophe&mdash;that it was no easy matter for him to make his way
      through it, and several minutes elapsed without witnessing his return. In
      the meantime the poor dog&rsquo;s struggles were becoming fainter and fainter;
      his whining had changed to something between a hoarse bark and a howl, a
      sound so clearly indicative of suffering as to be most distressing to the
      bystanders; and it was evident that if some effort were not speedily made
      for his relief he must sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall not perish unassisted!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis impetuously; &ldquo;who will
      lend me a knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several were immediately offered him, from which he selected one with a
      broad blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I inquire how you propose to prevent the impending catastrophe?&rdquo;
       asked superciliously the moustached gentleman to whom we have before
      alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see directly,&rdquo; returned Lewis, divesting himself of his coat,
      waistcoat, and neckcloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume you are aware there is not one man in a hundred who could swim
      that distance in his clothes,&rdquo; resumed the speaker in the same sneering
      tone. &ldquo;Do you actually&mdash;I merely ask as a matter of curiosity&mdash;do
      you really consider it worth while to peril your life for that of a dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For such a noble dog as that, yes!&rdquo; replied Lewis sternly. &ldquo;I might not
      take the trouble for a <i>mere puppy</i>;&rdquo; and he pronounced the last two
      words with a marked emphasis, which rendered his meaning unmistakable. The
      person he addressed coloured with anger and slightly raised his cane, but
      he read that in Lewis&rsquo;s face which caused him to relinquish his intention,
      and smiling scornfully he folded his arms and remained to observe the
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Lewis&rsquo;s introduction to Charles Leicester&rsquo;s elder brother, Lord
      Bellefield, the affianced of Annie Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having completed his preparations, Lewis placed the knife between his
      teeth, and motioning to the crowd to stand on one side, gave a short run,
      dashed through the shallow water, and then, breasting the stream
      gallantly, swain with powerful strokes towards the still struggling
      animal. As he perceived his master approaching, the poor dog ceased
      howling, and seemingly re-animated by the prospect of assistance,
      redoubled his efforts to keep himself afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to avoid the stroke of his paws, Lewis swam round him, and
      supporting himself by resting one hand upon the buoy, he grasped the knife
      with the other, and at one stroke severed the string. The effect was
      instantly perceptible: freed from the restraint which had till now
      paralysed his efforts, the dog at once rose higher in the water; and even
      in that extremity his affection for his master overpowering his instinct
      of self-preservation, he swam towards him with the child&rsquo;s boat (of which,
      throughout the whole scene, he had never loosened his hold) in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merely waiting to assure himself that the animal had yet strength enough
      remaining to enable him to regain the shore, Lewis set him the example by
      quitting the buoy and striking out lustily for the bank; but now the
      weight of his clothes, thoroughly saturated as they had become, began to
      tell upon him, and his strokes grew perceptibly weaker, while his breath
      came short and thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faust, on the contrary, freed from the string which had entangled him,
      proceeded merrily, and reached the shore ere Lewis had performed half the
      distance. Depositing the boat in triumph at the feet of one of the
      bystanders, the generous animal only stopped to shake the wet from his
      ears, and then plunging in again swam to meet his master. It was perhaps
      fortunate that he did so, for Lewis&rsquo;s strength was rapidly deserting him,
      his clothes appearing to drag him down like leaden weights. Availing
      himself, of the dog&rsquo;s assistance, he placed one arm across its back, and
      still paddling with the other, he was partly dragged and partly himself
      swam forward, till his feet touched ground, when, letting the animal go
      free, he waded through the shallow water and reached the bank, exhausted
      indeed, but in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rejecting the many friendly offers of assistance with which he was
      instantly overwhelmed, he wrang the water from his dripping hair, stamped
      it out of his boots, and hastily resuming his coat and waistcoat, was
      about to quit a spot where he was the observed of all observers, when Lord
      Bellefield, after exchanging a few words with his companion, made a sign
      to attract Lewis&rsquo;s attention, and having succeeded in so doing, said,
      &ldquo;That is a fine dog of yours, sir; will you take a twenty pound note for
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s countenance, pale from exhaustion, flushed with anger at these
      words; pausing a moment, however, ere he replied, he answered coldly, &ldquo;Had
      he been for sale, sir, I should scarcely have risked drowning in order to
      save him; I value my life at more than twenty pounds.&rdquo; Then turning on his
      heel, he whistled Faust to follow him, and walked away at a rapid pace in
      the direction of Hyde Park Corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the carriages that immediately drove off was one containing two
      ladies who had witnessed the whole proceeding; and as it dashed by him,
      Lewis, accidentally looking up, caught a glimpse of the bright eager face
      of Annie Grant!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;WHEREIN RICHARD FRERE AND LEWIS TURN MAHOMETANS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ewis rather
      expected a lecture from Richard Frere on account of his aquatic exploit;
      but he need not have made himself uneasy on the subject, for the only
      remark his friend volunteered was: &ldquo;Well, you know, if the dog could not
      be saved without, of course you were obliged to go in and fetch him. I
      should have done the same myself, though I hate cold water as I hate the
      old gentleman, and never could swim in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had concluded dinner, Frere inquired suddenly: &ldquo;By the way, do
      you mean to come with me to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I can answer that question,&rdquo; returned Lewis, &ldquo;you must condescend
      to inform me where you are going, and what you mean to do when you get
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure; I thought I had told you; but the fact is, I have been
      working rather hard lately (I read for three hours after you were gone to
      bed last night), and my head is not over clear to-day. The case is this,
      sir: Tom Bracy, who, as I before told you, is lamentably addicted to
      practical jokes, happens to be acquainted with a certain elderly lady who
      devotes her life to lion-hunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To <i>what?</i>&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To catching celebrities, otherwise termed lions,&rdquo; replied Frere, &ldquo;and
      parading them at her parties for the benefit of her friends and
      acquaintance. On the last occasion of this kind she confided to Bracy her
      longing desire to obtain an introduction to a certain Persian prince, or
      thereabouts, who has lately come over to this country to avoid the
      somewhat troublesome attentions of his family, his younger brother being
      most anxious to put out his eyes, and his grandfather only waiting a
      favourable opportunity for bow-stringing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A little more than kin, and less than kind,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would say that,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;in fact, I should have felt
      quite surprised if you had not. But to proceed with my account. Bracy soon
      found out that his hostess had never seen the aforesaid Asiatic magnate,
      and knew next to nothing about him; whereupon he determined &lsquo;to get a
      little fun,&rsquo; as he calls it, out of the affair, and accordingly informed
      her, very gravely, that from his acquaintance with the Persian language,
      he was in the habit of accompanying the prince to evening parties in the
      character of interpreter, and that if she would entrust him with an
      invitation, he should be happy to convey it to his Highness, and try to
      induce him to accept it. She joyfully acceded to the proposal, and this
      very evening the party is to take place. And now can you guess the purport
      of Bracy&rsquo;s visit to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants you to act as interpreter in his stead, I suppose; his knowledge
      of Persian being probably confined to the word &lsquo;bosh.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong!&rdquo; rejoined Frere, laughing. &ldquo;A higher destiny awaits me. I am for
      the nonce to be elevated to the proud position of one of the Blood Royal
      of Persia. In plain English, Bracy knows as much of the Prince as I do of
      the Pope; the whole thing is a hoax from beginning to end, and he wants me
      to personate his Highness, which I have promised to do, while you are to
      represent an attendant satrap, a sort of Mussulman gold stick-in-waiting,
      always supposing you have no objection so to employ yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I am scarcely in the vein for such fooling,&rdquo;
       returned Lewis moodily. &ldquo;I hate practical jokes to begin with, nor can I
      see much fun in taking advantage of the absurdities of some weak-minded
      old lady. At the same time I am tolerably indifferent about the matter,
      and if you have pledged yourself to go, relying upon my accompanying you,
      I will put my own tastes out of the question, and do as you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Equally sententious and amiable,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;but the truth is, I
      have promised Bracy (partly fancying you would like the fun), and go I
      must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accompany you then,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d make a greater sacrifice
      than that for you any day, old fellow. And now may I ask who is the lady
      to be victimised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An opulent widow, one Lady Lombard, &lsquo;the interesting relict of a
      be-knighted pawnbroker,&rsquo; as Bracy calls her,&rdquo; replied Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who</i> inquired Lewis, becoming suddenly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how now?&rdquo; returned Frere, astonished at his friend&rsquo;s impetuosity.
      Then repeating the name, he continued, &ldquo;Do you know the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis; &ldquo;know her for a coarse-minded, purse-proud,
      wretched old woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; whistled Frere. &ldquo;May I ask how the good lady has been so fortunate
      as thus to have excited your bitter indignation against her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; returned Lewis, rising hastily and walking to the window;
      &ldquo;it is enough that I know her to be the character I have described.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd now,&rdquo; muttered Frere, soliloquising. &ldquo;If I had not been
      acquainted with his &lsquo;<i>antécêdens</i>&rsquo; as the French term it, nearly as
      well as I know my own, I should have fancied the late lamented Lombard
      had, in bygone hours, refused to negotiate some small loan for him, on the
      perishable security of personal clothing. He can&rsquo;t have popped the
      question to the widow at one of the German watering-places, and
      encountered a negative?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frere, don&rsquo;t mention my dislike of Lady Lombard to your facetious
      acquaintance,&rdquo; observed Lewis, turning round. &ldquo;I have no ambition to
      become a butt for his bad puns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear, man, I&rsquo;ll not betray your confidence,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;more
      particularly when, as in the present instance, I don&rsquo;t happen to share
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care to know?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by no manner of means, as the young lady said, when the parson asked
      her whether she was prepared to give up all the pomps and vanities of this
      wicked world,&rdquo; returned Frere. &ldquo;And now, as we have to be converted into
      Pagans before ten o&rsquo;clock, suppose we start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour&rsquo;s brisk walking brought them to Bracy&rsquo;s lodgings,
      where they found that gentleman deeply immersed in study, with the fez
      which was to assist in changing Frere into a prince stuck rakishly on one
      side of his head. On perceiving his visitors he sprang from his seat, and
      making a low salaam, in the course of which performance the fez tumbled
      off and knocked down a candle, he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most illustrious brothers of the Sun, and first-cousins once removed of
      the Moon and all the stars, may your shadows never be less! You do me
      proud by honouring my poor dwelling with your seraphic presences!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you have got the wherewithal to make Heathens of us,&rdquo; returned
      Frere, pointing to the couple of Persian dresses which hung against the
      wall like a brace of Bluebeard&rsquo;s headless wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bude Light of the Universe, yes!&rdquo; replied Bracy. &ldquo;Your slave has procured
      the &lsquo;<i>wear</i> with all&rsquo; necessary to complete your transformation from
      infidel Feringhees to true sons of Islam. Would I have had my prince
      appear without a khelaut&mdash;a dress of honour? Be Cheshm! upon my eyes
      be it;&mdash;by the way, it&rsquo;s a remarkable fact that the expression &lsquo;my
      eyes&rsquo; should be Court lingo in Persia, and bordering upon Billingsgate in
      English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem particularly well up in the pseudo-oriental metaphor to-night,
      Bracy,&rdquo; observed Frere; &ldquo;has the fez inspired you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing miraculous in the affair,&rdquo; returned Bracy; &ldquo;it is
      very easily explained. I have been reading up for the occasion&mdash;cramming,
      sir; a process successfully practised upon heavy Johnians at Cambridge and
      corpulent turkey poults in Norfolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! I was not aware that you are a Persian scholar. May I inquire
      what line of study you have adopted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One that I have myself struck out,&rdquo; responded Bracy, &ldquo;and which has been
      attended, I flatter myself, with the most successful results. I first
      subjected myself to a strict course of Hajji Baba, after which I underwent
      a very searching self-examination in Morie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Zohrab&rsquo;, or the &lsquo;Hostage.&rsquo; I
      next thoroughly confused my mind with &lsquo;Thalaba,&rsquo; but brought myself round
      again upon &lsquo;Bayley Frazer&rsquo;s Travels&rsquo;; after which I made myself master of
      &lsquo;Ayesha, or the Maid of Khars.&rsquo; And by way of laying in a fitting stock of
      the sentimental, finished off with Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Giaour&rsquo;;&mdash;stop, let me
      give you a specimen.&rdquo; And replacing the unruly fez, he sprang upon a
      chair, and throwing himself into a mock-tragedy attitude, began
      bombastically to recite&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas sweet, where cloudless stars were bright,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To view the wave of watery light,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And hear its melody by night;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And oft had Hassan&rsquo;s childhood play&rsquo;d
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Around the verge of that cascade:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And oft upon his mother&rsquo;s breast
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That sound had harmonised his rest;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And oft had Hassan&rsquo;s youth along
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Its banks been sooth&rsquo;d by Beauty&rsquo;s song,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And softer seem&rsquo;d each melting tone
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of music mingled with its own.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, I call that pretty well for a young beginner; a little of that
      will go a great way with my Lady Lombard; it is like a penny bun, cheap to
      begin with, and very filling at the price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turks and Persians are not exactly alike, though you seem to think they
      are,&rdquo; observed Frere dryly. &ldquo;Have you laid down any plan of operations,
      may I ask? You must give me very full and clear directions how to behave,
      for, to tell you the truth, my acquaintance with the manners and customs
      of the higher ranks of Persia is infinitesimally select.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s all plain sailing enough,&rdquo; returned Bracy; &ldquo;you have only to
      look wise, roll your eyes about, and occasionally jabber a little Persian,
      or any other unknown tongue you may prefer, which I, not understanding,
      shall translate <i>ad libitum</i> as the occasion may require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sweetly you will do it too, or I am much mistaken,&rdquo; muttered Frere,
      divesting himself of his greatcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray inform me, as I am unfortunately ignorant of all the oriental
      languages, how do you propose to supply my deficiencies?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
      &ldquo;Is my part, like Bottom the weaver&rsquo;s, to be nothing but roaring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as you are about to enact a lion, it would appear not inappropriate,&rdquo;
       returned Bracy. &ldquo;Yes, it never struck me; there seems a slight difficulty
      there&mdash;you never got up any <i>Memoria Technica</i>, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s unlucky,&rdquo; continued Bracy; &ldquo;a page or two of that would have
      served the purpose beautifully. I met a man the other night who had struck
      out a new system for himself, and was perfectly rabid about it. He had
      bottled, according to his own account, the whole history of England into
      an insinuating little word that sounded to me something like
      &lsquo;Humguffinhoggogrificicuana,&rsquo; and bagged all Hansard&rsquo;s Reports, from Pitt
      to Peel, in half-a-dozen lines of impossible doggerel. Oh! he was a
      wonderful fellow&mdash;clearly mad, but intensely funny. I kept him in tow
      two good hours, and made him explain his system twice over to everybody,
      till the people were ready to cry, he bored them so. I was nearly being
      punished for it though, as he was actually weak enough to believe in me,
      and called the next day to fraternise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you escape?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have a sort of tiger (the imp that let you in, in fact), who is a
      first-rate liar&mdash;most excellent, useful boy, I do assure you, sir; I
      sent him down with a message that I had an attack of Asiatic cholera, but
      if he would take a glass of wine, and look at the paper till the crisis
      should be over, I would come to him if it terminated favourably. That
      settled the business; he did not wait the event, but was off like a shot,
      thinking the Infection might disagree with his &lsquo;system,&rsquo; perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he has not repeated his visit?&rdquo; inquired Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and I hope he will not,&rdquo; returned Bracy, &ldquo;for there will be nothing
      left for me to have but Elephantiasis or the Plague, and he must be very
      far gone in innocence if he can swallow either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I expected to put on these things?&rdquo; asked Frere, holding up a most
      voluminous pair of Persian trousers, made of a species of silk gauze
      enriched with glittering spangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, verily, most emphatically and decidedly yes,&rdquo; replied Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what must be must be, I suppose,&rdquo; rejoined Frere, with a sigh of
      resignation; &ldquo;but I never thought to see myself in such a garment. &lsquo;Sure
      such a pair were never seen!&rsquo; One thing is clear, I must stand all the
      evening, for there&rsquo;s no man living could sit down in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; returned Bracy encouragingly; &ldquo;only do you go into my
      bedroom and put on your robes, and I&rsquo;ll ensure your &lsquo;taking your seat on
      your return.&rsquo; Never make mountains of molehills, man; there are worse
      dresses than that in the world; for instance, it might have been a kilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Frere reflectively, and unhooking the richest Mrs.
      Bluebeard, he proceeded after sundry ejaculations of disgust to carry it
      into the other room, whither after a minute or two Bracy followed him, to
      perform, as he said, the part of lady&rsquo;s-maid. After a lapse of about a
      quarter of an hour the door was again unclosed, and Bracy, exclaiming,
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Arundel, allow me to have the honour of introducing you to his
      Sublime Highness Ree Chard el Freer,&rdquo; ushered in the person named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was so complete a transformation seen. The Persian dress, rounding
      off and concealing the angularities of his figure, gave a sort of dignity
      to Frere, quite in keeping with the character he was about to assume;
      while moustaches and a flowing beard imparted a degree of picturesqueness
      to his countenance which accorded well with his irregular but expressive
      features and bright animated eyes. A shawl of rich pattern confined his
      waist, while a girdle, studded with (apparently) precious stones,
      sustained a sword and dagger, the jewelled hilts and brilliantly
      ornamented sheaths of which added not a little to the magnificence of his
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Voilà!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Bracy, patting him on the back. &ldquo;What do you
      think of that by way of a get-up? There&rsquo;s a ready-made prince for you.
      Asylum of the Universe, how do you find yourself? Do your new garments sit
      easily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your nonsense, sir,&rdquo; replied Frere. &ldquo;If I am a prince, behave to
      me as <i>sich</i>, if you please. I tell you what, I shall be tearing some
      of this drapery before the evening is over. Ah! well, it is not for life,
      that is one comfort; but I never was properly thankful before for not
      having been born a woman. Think of sinking into the vale of years in a
      muslin skirt&mdash;what a prospect for an intellectual being!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Arundel, your dress awaits you,&rdquo; said Bracy, &ldquo;and &lsquo;time is on
      the wing.&rsquo; We shall have her ladyship in hysterics if she fancies her
      prince means to disappoint her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s toilet was soon completed, and proved eminently successful, the
      flowing robe setting off his tall, graceful figure to the utmost
      advantage, and the scarlet fez, with its drooping tassel, contrasting well
      with his dark curls and enhancing the effect of his delicately cut and
      striking features. Bracy making his appearance at the same moment, most
      elaborately got up for the occasion, with a blue satin underwaistcoat and
      what he was pleased to denominate the Order of the Holy Poker suspended by
      a red ribbon from his button-hole, the tiger of lying celebrity was
      despatched for a vehicle, and the trio started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a reflective mind,&rdquo; began Bracy, when an interval of wood-pavement
      allowed conversation to become audible,&mdash;&ldquo;to a reflective mind, there
      is no section of the zoology of the London streets more interesting than
      that which treats of the habits and general economy of the genus cabman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to their general economy,&rdquo; returned Frere, &ldquo;as far as I am acquainted
      with it, it appears to consist in doing you out of more than their fare,
      and expending the capital thus acquired at a gin-palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you misapply terms, treat an important subject with unbecoming
      levity, and libel an interesting race of men,&rdquo; returned Bracy, with a
      countenance of the most immovable gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interests, you mean,&rdquo; rejoined Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One very striking peculiarity of the species,&rdquo; continued Bracy, not
      heeding the interruption, &ldquo;is their talent for subtle analysis of
      character, and power of discriminating it by the application of unusual
      tests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s coming now?&rdquo; inquired Frere. &ldquo;Keep your ears open, Lewis, my son,
      and acquire wisdom from the lips of the descendant of many Bracys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware an assertion of this nature should not be lightly hazarded,&rdquo;
       resumed Bracy, &ldquo;as it carries little conviction to the ill-regulated minds
      of the sceptical, unless it be verified by some illustrative example drawn
      from the actual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not got such a thing as a Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary about you, I
      suppose?&rdquo; interrupted Frere. &ldquo;I want to look out a few of those long
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With this view,&rdquo; resumed Bracy, &ldquo;I will relate a little anecdote, which
      will at the same time prove my position and display the capacity of the
      London cabman for terse and epigrammatic definition. I had been engaged on
      committee business at the House of Commons a short time since, and was
      returning to my lodgings when, as I emerged into Palace Yard, it began to
      rain. Seeing me without an umbrella, a cabman on the stand hailed me with
      a view of ascertaining whether I required his services. While I was
      debating with myself whether the rain was likely to increase or not, I was
      hailed by the cad of an omnibus just turning into Parliament Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never do make puns,&rdquo; began Frere, &ldquo;or else I should be inclined to ask
      whether being exposed to so much <i>hail</i> and rain at the same time did
      not give you cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened that I had just betted a new hat with a man,&rdquo; continued
      Bracy, still preserving the most perfect gravity, &ldquo;as to how many times
      the chairman of the committee would take snuff, and had lost my wager;
      this made me feel awfully stingy, and accordingly availing myself of the
      lowest of the two estimates, I fraternised with the &rsquo;bus fellow,
      and metaphorically threw over the cabman. As I was ascending the steps of
      the vehicle I had resolved to patronise, the following remark from the
      injured Jehu reached my ears; it was addressed to an amphibious
      individual, &lsquo;<i>en sabots et bandeaux de foin</i>&rsquo; (as the <i>Morning Post</i>
      would have it), yclept the waterman; and if you don&rsquo;t think it fully bears
      out my previous assertions, I can only say that you are an incompetent
      judge of evidence. He first attracted his friend&rsquo;s attention by pointing
      to me over his shoulder with his thumb, and winking significantly; then
      added in a tone of intense disgust, &lsquo;See that cove; I thort he worn&rsquo;t no
      good.&lsquo;Stead o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; a cab to his self, like a gent, he&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo; to have
      <i>threepen&rsquo;orth of all sorts</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; As Bracy, amid the laughter of his
      companions, concluded his recital, the vehicle which conveyed them drew up
      at the door of Lady Lombard&rsquo;s mansion.

      CHAPTER X.&mdash;CONTAINS A PRACTICAL COMMENTARY ON THE PROVERB, &ldquo;ALL IS
      NOT GOLD WHICH GLITTERS.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ady Lombard, being
      in many senses of the word a great lady, lived in a great house, which
      looked out upon that gloomy sight, a London garden, and had its front door
      at the back for the sake of appearances. At this perverted entrance did
      Bracy&rsquo;s mendacious tiger, standing on tip-toe the better to reach the
      knocker, fulminate like a duodecimo edition of Olympian Jove, until two
      colossal footmen, in a great state of excitement and scarlet plush, opened
      the door so suddenly as nearly to cause the prostration of the booted boy,
      who only saved himself from falling by stumbling, boots and all, against
      the tall shin of the highest footman, thereby eliciting from that noble
      creature an ejaculation suggestive of his intense appreciation of the
      injury done him, and hinting, not obscurely, at his wishes in regard to
      the future destiny of his juvenile assailant. That youth, however, who, we
      are forced to confess, was not only as &ldquo;impudent as he was high,&rdquo; but,
      reckoning by the peculiar standard which the expression aforesaid
      indicates, at the very least three feet more so, hastened thus to rebuke
      his adversary: &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s lucky for you, Maypole, as I hain&rsquo;t hon the bench of
      majorstraits yet, hor ther&rsquo;d a been five bob hout o&rsquo; your red plush
      pockets for swearin&rsquo;, as sure has heggs is heggs! Hif that&rsquo;s hall yer
      gratitude for me a-bringin&rsquo; of ye my honourable master and two noble
      Purshun princes, hi&rsquo;d better horder the carridge to turn round and take&rsquo;em
      back agen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having astonished the disgusted giant by this speech, the imp bounded down
      the steps and held open the cab-door with an air of dignified
      condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that boy a treasure?&rdquo; whispered Bracy to Frere as they alighted.
      &ldquo;How neatly he took the shine out of that thick-witted pyramid of fool&rsquo;s
      flesh! I could not have done the thing better myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to any very unusual powers of foresight,&rdquo; muttered Frere
      under his beard, &ldquo;but I think I could point out that brat&rsquo;s residuary
      legatee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; returned Bracy; &ldquo;and who do you fix upon? the Archbishop of
      Canterbury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the hangman,&rdquo; was the gruff reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d myself venture to insure him against drowning for a very
      moderate premium,&rdquo; rejoined his master, laughing; &ldquo;but now I really must
      beg you to bear in mind that you are utterly ignorant of the English
      language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inshallah! I&rsquo;d forgotten my illustrious descent most completely,&rdquo;
       answered Frere, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll be careful; so, for the next three hours, &lsquo;my
      native&rsquo; tongue, &lsquo;good-night.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation had been carried on in an undertone, the party had
      been ushered upstairs amidst the wondering gaze of servants innumerable,
      of all sorts and sizes, from the little foot-page staggering under a
      galaxy of buttons to the mighty butler barely able to walk beneath the
      weight of his own dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name shall I say, gentlemen?&rdquo; asked the last-named official in his
      most insinuating tone; for a Persian prince was a rarity sufficient to
      impress even his imperturbable spirit with a sense of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Highness Prince Mustapha Ali Khan and suite,&rdquo; returned Bracy
      authoritatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the door of a well-lighted saloon was flung back on its
      hinges, and in a stentorian voice the major domo announced, &ldquo;His Highness
      Prince Mystify-all-I-can and see-it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! he&rsquo;s hit it,&rdquo; whispered Bracy to Lewis, as, following Frere,
      they entered the room. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t beat that if he tries till he&rsquo;s black in
      the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he finished speaking, the guests, who had crowded as near the door as
      good breeding would allow to witness the Prince&rsquo;s <i>entrée</i>, drew back
      as a rustling of silks and satins announced the approach of their hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lombard, who, to judge by appearances, would never again celebrate
      her forty-fifth birthday, had been a handsome, and still was a
      fine-looking woman. She was tall and portly; in fact portly is rather a
      mild term to use in speaking of her ladyship, but we don&rsquo;t like to
      stigmatise her as stout, and beyond that we could not go in speaking of a
      lady. She had a very bright colour and a very fair skin, in the display of
      which she was by no means niggardly, her gown having short sleeves (so
      short, indeed, as scarcely to be worth mentioning), and being&mdash;&mdash;well,
      we know a French word which would express our meaning, but we prefer our
      own language, and must therefore say, being rather too much off where it
      would have been better a little more on. She wore a profusion of light
      ringlets, which we feel justified in stating, upon our personal
      responsibility, to have been her own, for Lady Lombard was an honourable
      woman, and paid her bills most punctually. These flaxen locks rejoiced in
      one peculiarity&mdash;they were not divided in the centre, after the usual
      method, but the <i>in medio tutissimns ibis</i> principle had been
      abandoned in favour of a new and striking coiffure, which, until we were
      introduced to her ladyship, we had believed to be restricted to the
      blue-and-silver epicene pages who worship the prima donna and poke fun at
      the soubrettes on the opera stage. The page-like parting, then, was on one
      side of her head, and across her ample forehead lay a festoon of hair,
      arranged so as to suggest, to a speculative mind, a fanciful resemblance
      to the drapery at the top of a window curtain. Her features were by no
      means without expression; on the contrary, meek pomposity and innocent
      self-satisfaction were written in legible characters on her good-natured
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most carefully written descriptions usually prove inadequate to convey
      to the reader&rsquo;s mind a just idea of the object they would fain depict; but
      as we are especially anxious that others should see Lady Lombard with our
      eyes, we must beg their attention to the following simple process, by
      which we trust to enable them to realise her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let each reader, then, call to mind the last average specimen of fat and
      fair babyhood which may have come under his notice; let him imagine it
      clothed in the richest sky-blue satin; let him deprive it of its coral,
      and substitute in its place a gold watch and appendages; round its fat
      little excuse for a neck let him clasp a diamond necklace; let him dress
      its hair, or provide it a flaxen wig&mdash;if its hair should be as yet a
      pleasure to come&mdash;made after the fashion we have above described; and
      let him, lastly, by a powerful effort of imagination, inflate this baby
      until, still preserving its infantine proportions, it shall stand five
      feet nine in its satin shoes,&mdash;and he will then have arrived at a
      very correct idea of Lady Lombard as she appeared when, rustling forward
      in a tremor of delight, she advanced to perform the part of gracious
      hostess to the Prince of Persia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Bracy,&rdquo; she began, as that gentleman, with a countenance of
      solemn satisfaction, stepped forward to meet her, &ldquo;really, this is <i>too</i>
      kind of you; how do you do? So you have positively brought me the <i>dear</i>
      prince? <i>Will</i> you introduce me to him, and explain to him how <i>very</i>
      much honoured I am by his condescension in coming this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Be it observed, by the way, that her ladyship spoke with the greatest <i>empressement</i>,
      and had a habit of uttering many of her words in italics, not to say small
      capitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will give me much satisfaction to do so,&rdquo; returned Bracy, with grave
      courtesy; &ldquo;but I can assure you the prince came quite of his own accord.
      The moment I had explained your invitation to him he caught the note out
      of my hand, pressed it three times to his forehead, and exclaimed in the
      court dialect of Iraun, &lsquo;<i>Hahazyr imeyur manzur</i>, he did, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o-o, <i>really!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated Lady Lombard, more emphatically than
      she had ever yet spoken in her life; then, as a faint glimmering came
      across her that there was a slight anomaly in appearing so deeply
      interested in a remark which she could by no possibility understand, she
      added: &ldquo;But you should recollect, Mr. Bracy, that <i>every</i> one does
      not possess your remarkable acquaintance with the Eastern languages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psha! how forgetful I am!&rdquo; returned Bracy. &ldquo;Your ladyship must excuse me;
      the prince has been so short a time in this country that I am scarcely yet
      accustomed to my new duties. The few words I had the honour to repeat to
      you merely signify&mdash;you know the Eastern metaphors are very peculiar&mdash;&lsquo;I
      will kiss&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s the usual form of accepting any distinguished
      invitation&mdash;&lsquo;I will kiss her ladyship&rsquo;s door-mat!&rsquo; Curious, is it
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>indeed</i>,&rdquo; was the sympathetic reply. At the same moment Bracy,
      turning to Frere, presented him to their hostess, saying &ldquo;Prince, this is
      Lady Lombard&mdash;<i>Twygt-hur rhumauld gâl!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first sound that escaped his Highness was a hysterical grunt which, in
      an Englishman, might have been deemed indicative of suppressed laughter,
      but proceeding from the bearded lips of a Persian potentate, assumed the
      character of an Eastern ejaculation. After muttering a few <i>real</i>
      Persian words with an appearance of deep respect, Frere took her
      ladyship&rsquo;s plump white hand between both his own and raised it to his
      lips; then, relinquishing it, he spoke again, made a low salaam, and
      drawing himself up to his full height, crossed his arms on his breast and
      stood motionless before her. The appealing looks which she cast upon Bracy
      when the prince spoke was a severe trial to his gravity; but by long
      experience in practical joking he had acquired wonderful command of
      countenance, which stood him now in good stead, and he proceeded to
      translate Frere&rsquo;s sentences into certain flowery and unmeaning
      compliments, which were about as unlike their real signification as need
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Lewis had gone through the same ceremony without the speeches, for
      which omission Bracy accounted by explaining that it was not etiquette for
      the Persian nobles to speak when in attendance on their princes, they were
      led to the upper end of the apartment, where Frere seated himself
      cross-legged on a sofa and made himself very much at home, keeping Bracy
      fully employed in inventing translations to speeches, not one word of
      which he, or any one else present, comprehended. Lewis, in the meantime,
      who was becoming dreadfully tired of the whole affair, stood near the end
      of the sofa, with his arms folded across his breast, looking especially
      scornful and very particularly bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Lombard, as a pretty, graceful girl, very simply
      dressed, made her way up the room, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that <i>dear</i> Laura Peyton
      arrived. I <i>must</i> go and speak to her, and bring her to be introduced
      to the Prince.&rdquo; She then added, aside to Bracy, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>immensely</i>
      rich; clear six thousand a year, and does not spend two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very charming trait in her character,&rdquo; returned Bracy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention it
      to the Prince. I don&rsquo;t know that there ever <i>was</i> an Englishwoman
      queen of Persia; but that&rsquo;s no reason there never should be one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bracy was accordingly introduced to the young lady, and led her, smiling
      and blushing, up to Frere, by whom he seated her, and paved the way for
      conversation by the following remark:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tharmy buoi aintsheaz tunnar?</i>&rdquo; which for the damsel&rsquo;s edification
      he translated&mdash;&ldquo;Asylum of the Universe! the maiden, the daughter of
      roses, salutes thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a short interval Lady Lombard again bore down upon them in full
      sail, towing in her wake a small, hirsute, baboon-like individual,
      evidently one of her menagerie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chimpanzee!&rdquo; whispered Bracy to Frere. &ldquo;Now, if that picture of
      ugliness turns out an eastern traveller we&rsquo;re gone &rsquo;coons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned Frere in the same tone, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only an exiled
      something. He came to our shop with a recommendation from some of the
      Parisian <i>savans</i> the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must trouble you <i>once</i> again, Mr. Bracy,&rdquo; insinuated Lady
      Lombard. &ldquo;Professor Malchapeau is <i>dying</i> to be introduced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trouble, but a pleasure,&rdquo; returned Bracy. &ldquo;I shall have the greatest
      satisfaction in making two such illustrious individuals known to each
      other. Does the Professor speak English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas; I vas spik Angleesh von pritté veil,&rdquo; replied the person alluded to,
      strutting forward on tiptoe. &ldquo;I ave zie honaire to vish you how you did,
      my prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere made some reply, which Bracy paraphrased into &ldquo;The descendant of
      many Shahs kisses the hem of the mantle of the Father of science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Professor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Angleesh&rdquo; not providing him with a suitable reply ready
      made, he was obliged to resort to that refuge for destitute foreigners&mdash;a
      shrug and a grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lombard came to his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Professor, suppose you were to tell his Highness your affecting
      history;&rdquo; adding in a whisper, &ldquo;Mr. Bracy, the interpreter, is connected
      with government, and might be of the greatest use to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ohf, miladi, if all zie bodies had your big heart in dem, zies vicked
      vorld should be von eaven,&rdquo; replied the Professor, gratefully, through his
      talented nose. &ldquo;My littel storie! ohf, zie Prince should not vant to ear
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Highness, however, being graciously pleased to signify his anxiety so
      to do, the small man resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>ma Patri!</i> vhats I ave come thro&rsquo; for him, ven I vill <i>raconte</i>
      nobody shall not belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To enable the Prince to understand your account more clearly,&rdquo;
       interrupted Bracy, &ldquo;may I ask to what country it relates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vidout von doubt, saire! you shall tell zie Prince dat my littel tale is
      Swish. My fadaire vas vot you call von mayor of zie canton of Zurich. My
      brodaire and myselfs vas his only schild; since a long time ve vas live
      very appy, <i>mais enfin</i>&mdash;but on his end&mdash;zie <i>sacré
      Autriche</i>&mdash;von bad Oystrish government, did vot you call oppress
      <i>ma pauvre patrie</i>, and my fadaire, <i>toujours brave</i>, got
      himself into von littel conspiration, vaire he did commit vat you call zie
      offence politique; vas trown to prison, and in his confinement he did die.
      Ah! &lsquo;<i>mourir pour la patrie, c&rsquo;est doux</i>,&rsquo; to die for zie country is
      zie&mdash;vat you call <i>doux</i> in Angleesh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find the same word in both languages, Professor, only we
      pronounce it deuce,&rdquo; replied Bracy politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! c&rsquo;est bon, to die for zie country is zie deuce! <i>Eh bien</i>, after
      my poor fadaire was entombed, my brodaire did run himselfs avay, and vas
      converted to <i>un berger</i>, a little shepherd of cows, and I, <i>hélas!
      Pour moi, fêtais désolé</i>&mdash;for myself, I was dissolute, left alone
      in zie vide vorld, visout von friend to turn against. <i>Mais le ciel
      embrace les orphelins</i>&mdash;eaven embarrasses zie orphans; I marched
      on my foot to Paris; I found an unexpected uncle, who had supposed himself
      dead for some years; I undervent all zie sciences, and <i>enfin me voici</i>&mdash;on
      my end here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most affecting history indeed,&rdquo; returned Bracy, covering his mouth with
      his hand to conceal a smile. As for Frere, he had for some time past been
      nearly suffocated by suppressed laughter, which at length made itself so
      apparent that nothing but his beard and an assumed fit of coughing could
      have saved him from discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation had been going on, Miss Peyton called Lady
      Lombard&rsquo;s attention to Lewis by observing: &ldquo;The interpreter, in
      entertaining the Prince, seems entirely to have forgotten that very
      handsome young attendant who stands there, looking so haughty and
      disconsolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! so he does,&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Lombard anxiously. &ldquo;How <i>very</i>
      handsome he is! such a thoroughly Eastern countenance! <i>He&rsquo;s</i> a man
      of very high rank, too, over there. What <i>could</i> we do to amuse him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we might show him some prints,&rdquo; suggested Laura; &ldquo;at all events
      the attention might please him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>yes!</i> how <i>clever</i> of you! I should never have thought of
      that now. I&rsquo;ve a table covered with them in the boudoir,&rdquo; exclaimed Lady
      Lombard delightedly; &ldquo;but do you think you could turn them over for him?
      I&rsquo;m so foolish, I should be quite <i>nervous</i>; you see it&rsquo;s so awkward
      his not understanding English, poor fellow! I know I&rsquo;m <i>very</i>
      foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be most happy to do anything I can to lessen your difficulties,&rdquo;
       replied the young lady good-naturedly. &ldquo;Shall I look out a book of
      prints?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you <i>would</i> be so kind, my dear, you&rsquo;ll find <i>plenty</i> in the
      boudoir; and I&rsquo;ll go to Mr. Bracy and get him to speak to him for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The result of this application was the capture of Lewis, who, inwardly
      raging, was carried off to the boudoir and seated at a table, while Miss
      Peyton, half frightened, half amused, turned over a volume of prints for
      his edification. Lady Lombard and sundry of the guests stood round for
      some minutes watching the smiles and pantomimic gestures with which Lewis,
      or rather Hassan Bey, as Bracy had named him, felt bound to acknowledge
      the young lady&rsquo;s attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the guests who were thus amusing themselves lounged a young dandy,
      who, on the strength of a Mediterranean yacht voyage, set up for a
      distinguished traveller. To Lady Lombard&rsquo;s inquiry whether he spoke
      Persian he simpered, &ldquo;Re&rsquo;ely&mdash;no, not exactly so as to talk to him;
      but he&rsquo;ll do vastly well. They prefer silence, re&rsquo;ely, those fellows do.
      You know I&rsquo;ve seen so much of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in Persia, were you not?&rdquo; asked one of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Re&rsquo;ely&mdash;not exactly in his part of Persia. Stamboul, the city of
      palaces, was my headquarters: but it&rsquo;s much the same; indolence, beards,
      and tobacco are the characteristics of both races.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he is charmingly handsome?&rdquo; asked an old young lady,
      shaking her ringlets after a fashion which five years before had been a
      very &ldquo;telling&rdquo; manoeuvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Re&rsquo;ely, I should scarcely have said so,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;the boy is well
      enough for an Asiatic, I like a more&mdash;ahem!&mdash;manly style of
      thing.&rdquo; And as he spoke he passed his hand caressingly over a violent pair
      of red whiskers which garnished his own hard-featured physiognomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool impudence of this remark inspired Lewis with so intense a
      sentiment of disgust that his lip curled involuntarily, and he turned over
      the print before him with a gesture of impatience. On looking up he was
      rather disconcerted to find Laura Peyton&rsquo;s piercing black eyes watching
      him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given us nothing new in the musical way lately, Lady Lombard,&rdquo;
       observed the &ldquo;sere and yellow leaf&rdquo; damsel before alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect a lady to stay with me soon,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;whom I <i>think</i>
      you&rsquo;ll be pleased with; she sings and plays in very<i> first</i>-rate
      style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Is she an amateur or professional, may I inquire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, <i>really</i>, my dear Miss Sparkless, you&rsquo;ve asked a difficult
      question. The fact is,&rdquo; continued Lady Lombard, sinking her voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      one of those <i>very</i> sad cases, reduced fortune&mdash;you understand.
      I mean to have her here <i>merely</i> out of charity.&rdquo; Sinking her voice
      still lower, the following words only became audible: &ldquo;Wife of a Captain
      Arundel&mdash;foreign extraction originally&mdash;quite a <i>mésalliance</i>,
      I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke some new arrival attracted her attention, and she and her
      confidante left the boudoir together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may easily be conceived with what feelings of burning indignation Lewis
      had listened to the foregoing remarks; but Frere&rsquo;s lecture of the morning
      had not been without its fruits. With his anger the necessity for
      self-control presented itself, and he was congratulating himself at having
      checked all outward signs of annoyance when he was startled by a silvery
      voice whispering in his ear: &ldquo;Persian or no Persian, sir, you understand
      English as well as I do;&rdquo; and slightly turning, his eyes encountered those
      of Laura Peyton fixed on him with a roguish glance. His resolution was
      instantly taken, and he replied in the same tone: &ldquo;Having discovered my
      secret, you must promise to keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed, on one condition,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you immediately make a full confession and tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a compact,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; rejoined the young lady. &ldquo;Now move the portfolio, so that
      your back will be towards those people. That will do. Hold down your head
      as if you were examining the prints, and then answer my questions truly
      and concisely. First, you are an English gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, Richard Frere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why have you both come here dressed like Persians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To mystify our foolish hostess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, sir! I&rsquo;m very fond of Lady Lombard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know she is a silly woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind. Who planned this hoax?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bracy, the so-called interpreter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Prince Frere talk real Persian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does the other man understand him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he invents all the answers? That&rsquo;s rather clever of him. I shall go
      and listen presently. And you can&rsquo;t talk either Persian or gibberish, so
      you held your tongue and looked sulky. Well, I think it&rsquo;s all very wrong;
      but it&rsquo;s rather droll. Poor, dear Lady Lombard! she&rsquo;d never survive it if
      she did but know! And now, tell me, lastly, what put you in a rage just
      this minute and enabled me to find you out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not care to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do care to know, sir, and you have promised to answer all my
      questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard the speech that woman made about a Mrs. Arundel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Learn, then, that my name is Lewis Arundel, and the lady referred to was
      my mother. Now do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis uttered these words, in atone of suppressed bitterness, his
      companion hastily turned her head and said, in a low, hurried voice&mdash;&ldquo;I
      beg your pardon! I fear I have pained you; but I did not know&mdash;I
      could not guess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not distress yourself,&rdquo; returned Lewis kindly, Rose&rsquo;s smile for a
      moment smoothing his haughty brow and playing round his proud mouth. &ldquo;I am
      sure you would not hurt any one&rsquo;s feelings knowingly; and since you
      observed my annoyance, I am glad to have been able to explain its cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So engrossed had they been by this conversation that they had not observed
      Miss Sparkless enter the boudoir by another door; and they were first made
      aware of her presence by seeing her standing, breathless with
      astonishment, at discovering Miss Peyton in familiar colloquy with a
      Persian nobleman utterly ignorant of the English language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you speak German?&rdquo; asked Lewis quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little,&rdquo; returned Miss Peyton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not caught a word yet,&rdquo; continued Lewis. &ldquo;Tell her you found out
      by accident that I had picked up a few German sentences when the Prince
      was at the court of Prussia. White lies, unhappily, are inevitable on
      these occasions,&rdquo; he continued, seeing his companion hesitate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
      only way to prevent an <i>éclaircissementt</i>; and then, think of poor
      Lady Lombard&rsquo;s feelings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I seem fairly embarked in the conspiracy, I suppose I must do your
      bidding,&rdquo; was the reply, and Miss Sparkless, the middle-aged young lady,
      was accordingly informed of Lewis&rsquo;s German proficiency, whereat, falling
      into an ecstasy, she replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How charming! What a dear creature he is!&rdquo; On which the dear creature
      himself, catching Miss Peyton&rsquo;s eye, was very near laughing outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura, my <i>love</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Lombard, entering hastily, &ldquo;the
      Prince is going down to supper; will you come?&rdquo; Then taking her hand
      caressingly, she added, &ldquo;Have you been <i>very</i> much bored by him, poor
      fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found he could speak a few words of German, and that helped us on,&rdquo; was
      the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>really</i>&mdash;ah; we might have thought of <i>that</i>
      before,&rdquo; returned Lady Lombard, by no means certain the German language
      might not form an important and customary branch of Persian education.
    </p>
    <p>
      During supper Laura Peyton contrived to be seated between Frere and Bracy,
      the latter of whom she kept so constantly engaged in interpreting for her
      that he scarcely got anything to eat, and came to the conclusion that in
      the whole course of his experience he had never before encountered such a
      talking woman. Nor was his annoyance diminished by observing that Lewis,
      who was seated opposite, appeared to be deriving the utmost amusement from
      his discomfiture. Having exhausted every possible pretext for breaking off
      the conversation, and being each time foiled by the young lady&rsquo;s quiet
      tact, he was about to resign himself to his fate and relinquish all idea
      of supper, when a project occurred to him which he immediately hastened to
      put into execution. Waiting till Frere had spoken a Persian sentence, he
      suddenly drew himself up, looking deeply scandalised, frowned at the
      speaker, shook his head and muttered something unintelligible in a tone of
      grave remonstrance, then paused for a reply, which Frere, intensely
      perplexed, and by no means clear that he had not done something un-Persian
      and wrong, was forced to utter. This only seemed to make matters worse:
      Bracy again remonstrated in gibberish, then appeared to have determined on
      his course, and muttering, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no help for it, I suppose,&rdquo; he
      turned to Lady Lombard, and began in a tone of deep concern&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a most disagreeable duty to perform, and must beg you to believe
      that nothing but absolute necessity could have induced me to mention the
      matter; but I have remonstrated with his Highness without effect, and I
      dare go no further&mdash;he is subject to most violent bursts of passion,
      and becomes dangerous when opposed. He drew his dagger and attempted to
      stab me only yesterday, because I interfered to prevent his having one of
      the waiters of the hotel strangled with a bow-string.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lombard turned pale on receiving this information, while Bracy
      continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most unfortunate, but the Prince has been so much delighted with
      this young lady&rsquo;s charming flow of conversation that, in his ignorance of
      the customs of this country, he has actually commissioned me to offer you
      £500 for her, and declared his determination of taking her home with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this communication may be &ldquo;better imagined than described.&rdquo;
       Miss Peyton, aware of the true state of affairs, hid her face in her
      handkerchief in an uncontrollable fit of laughter; Lewis, sorely tempted
      to follow her example, bent over his plate till the flowing tassel of the
      fez concealed his features; Frere, excessively annoyed at the false
      imputation, all but began a flat denial of the charge in somewhat forcible
      English, but remembering his assumed character just in time, clenched his
      fist and ground his teeth with impatience, while Lady Lombard, observing
      these gestures, and construing them into indications of an approaching
      burst of fury, was nearly swooning with terror, when a note was put into
      her hands by a servant; hastily casting her eyes over it, she handed it to
      Bracy, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most fortunate; it may serve to divert his attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he became aware of its contents his countenance fell, and holding it so
      that Frere might read it, he whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a treat! We <i>are</i> in for it now, and no mistake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, Persian Professor at Addiscombe,
      presents his compliments to Lady Lombard, and begs to inform her that
      being only in town for a few hours, and learning accidentally that his
      Highness Prince Mustapha Ali was spending the evening at her house, he has
      ventured to request her permission to intrude upon her uninvited, as he is
      most anxious to renew his acquaintance with his Highness, whom he had the
      honour to know in Persia.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;TOM BRACY MEETS HIS MATCH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he position in
      which we left Lewis and his friends at the conclusion of the preceding
      chapter was decidedly more peculiar than agreeable, and afforded no bad
      illustration of the American expression, &ldquo;a pretty tall fix.&rdquo; Bracy, the
      fertile in expedients, was the first to hazard a suggestion, which he did
      by whispering to Frere, &ldquo;You had better be taken suddenly ill; I shall say
      you have had too much tongue (if you have not, I have), and that it has
      disagreed with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;you have seen the real Prince, haven&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bracy nodded in assent, and Frere continued, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s something like me, is
      he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better looking,&rdquo; was the uncomplimentary rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind that,&rdquo; resumed Frere. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t set up for a beauty, but
      if I am sufficiently like to pass for him I might contrive to humbug the
      fellow for a few minutes, and then we could manage to slip away quietly
      without any shindy at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can try it on if you choose, but he is safe to find you out, unless
      he is a perfect fool, and that is too great a mercy to hope for,&rdquo; returned
      Bracy dejectedly. &ldquo;If the worst comes to the worst, pretend to pick a
      quarrel with him, draw your carving-knife and make a poke at him; then
      Arundel and I will bundle him out of the room bodily, and swear we are
      doing it to save his life. I can see nothing else for it, for there go the
      women, and, by Jove, here&rsquo;s the learned Pundit himself! Oh! isn&rsquo;t he
      pretty to look at? Why, he is a fac-simile of the picture in the old
      editions of Gay&rsquo;s Fables, of &lsquo;the Monkey who had seen the World.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this dialogue was proceeding, Lady Lombard, having gathered the
      ladies under her wing, had marched them off to the drawing-room, Miss
      Peyton finding an opportunity as she passed Lewis to say, in German, &ldquo;Tell
      your Prince that when I sell myself I shall want a great deal more than
      £500.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, that your value is quite inestimable,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I am glad you have sufficient penetration to
      have found it out already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The description given by Bracy of the Doctor&rsquo;s outward man was by no means
      inapt. His hair and whiskers were grey, and, still adhering to the
      fashions of his younger days, he wore powder and a pig-tail. His dress
      consisted of a black single-breasted coat with a stand-up collar, knee
      breeches, and silk stockings; a profusion of shirt-frill rushed
      impetuously out of the front of his waistcoat, a stiff white neckcloth
      appeared thoroughly to deserve the appellation of &ldquo;choker&rdquo; which Bracy
      applied to it, while a shirt-collar starched to a pitch of savage
      harshness invaded the region of his cheeks to an extent which rendered the
      tract of country lying between the ears and the corners of the mouth a
      complete <i>terra incognita</i>. Constant study of the Eastern
      hieroglyphics had probably rendered his wearing spectacles a matter of
      necessity; at all events a huge pair in a broad tortoiseshell setting
      garnished his nose, which, truth compels us to confess, was more than
      slightly red, in which particular it afforded a decided contrast to his
      general complexion, which was, we say it distinctly and without
      compromise, yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this gentleman, who entered with a hasty step and glanced round him
      with a quick, abrupt, and rather startling manner, did Bracy address
      himself with much <i>empressement</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, this is most fortunate; the Prince is quite delighted at the
      rencontre, but you must expect to find his Highness greatly altered. The
      cares of life, my dear sir, the anxieties attending&mdash;ah! I see you
      are impatient; I won&rsquo;t detain you, but I wished to warn you that if you
      should perceive any great change in his appearance, you must not be
      surprised, and above all be careful not to show it by your manner. You
      have no idea how sensitive he is on the point; quite morbidly so, really.
      Don&rsquo;t let me detain you&mdash;how well you are looking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A good deal of pantomimic action had accompanied the delivery of this
      speech, the Doctor being engaged in making vain and futile attempts to get
      past his persecutor, who on his part continued, with an affectation of the
      deepest respect, constantly, and with the utmost perseverance, to
      frustrate them. The concluding words of his address, however, elicited the
      following rejoinder, spoken in a quick, cross manner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the advantage of me, sir, for I do not remember ever setting
      eyes on you before in my life. I never forget a face I have once seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound his memory!&rdquo; thought Bracy, &ldquo;Frere won&rsquo;t have a chance with
      him;&rdquo; he only said, however, &ldquo;You are right, Doctor; the fact of your
      looking well is so self-evident that I ventured to remark it, without
      having any previous data to go upon&mdash;but here is his Highness,&rdquo; and
      as he spoke, he at length moved on one side and allowed the man of
      learning to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frere coming forward at the same minute, Bracy whispered, while the Doctor
      bent in a low salaam:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have bothered his brains sweetly for him, he hardly knows whether he&rsquo;s
      standing on his head or his heels; so now you must take care of yourself,
      and joy go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere, thus apostrophised, returned the Doctor&rsquo;s salute with much
      cordiality, and Bracy, feigning some excuse, left them to entertain each
      other, having before his eyes a wholesome dread of the newcomer&rsquo;s
      addressing him in Persian, and thereby discovering his deplorable
      ignorance of that interesting language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, which does not stand still for princes any more than for private
      individuals, passed on with its usual rapidity. Most of the gentlemen
      having eaten as much, and drunk probably more (looking at it in a medical
      point of view) than was good for them, had rejoined the ladies, and it
      became evident to Bracy that a crisis in his evening&rsquo;s amusement was
      approaching. On his return to the drawing-room he must of course resume
      his duties as interpreter, and this inconvenient Persian professor would
      inevitably discover the imposture. This was the more provoking, as Frere&rsquo;s
      likeness to the Prince must evidently have been much stronger than he had
      imagined, and his acquaintance with the rules of Persian etiquette more
      extensive than he had believed possible, for the Doctor continued to
      converse with the utmost gravity, and appeared to believe in him
      implicitly. While he was still pondering the matter in his anxious mind,
      the few last remaining guests conveyed themselves away, and the Prince and
      his party were left to dispute possession of the supper-room with empty
      champagne bottles and half-tipsy waiters. Frere, when he perceived this to
      be the case, beckoned Bracy to approach, and as soon as he was within
      earshot, whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have humbugged the old fellow beautifully on the score of our Persian
      recollections, but he has just been questioning me about you,&mdash;where
      you acquired your knowledge of the language, whether you have been much in
      the East, how I became acquainted with you, and all the rest of it. I put
      him off with lies as long as I could, but it would not do, and as a last
      resource, I have been obliged to refer him to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you have!&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;that is pleasant. He&rsquo;ll be jabbering
      his confounded lingo, and I shall not understand a word he says to me;
      besides, my jargon won&rsquo;t go down with him, you know. I tell you what, I
      shall be off, and you must say upstairs (he can interpret for you) that I
      have been sent for by the prime minister at a minute&rsquo;s notice, <i>à la</i>
      De Grandeville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too late,&rdquo; replied Frere; and at the same instant the Doctor
      seized Bracy by the button, and in a stern and impressive manner asked
      some apparently searching question in Persian. Few men had enjoyed the
      delight of seeing Tom Bracy in the unenviable frame of mind expressed by
      the nautical term &ldquo;taken aback,&rdquo; but of that favoured few were the
      bystanders on the present occasion. Never was an unhappy individual more
      thoroughly and completely at a loss; and it must be confessed the
      situation was an embarrassing one. To be addressed by an elderly stranger
      in an unintelligible language, in which you are expected to reply, while
      at the same time you are painfully conscious that your incapacity to do
      so, or even (not understanding the question) to give an appropriate answer
      in your native tongue, will lead to a discovery you are most anxious to
      avert, is an undeniably awkward position in which to be placed. That Bracy
      found it so was most evident, for he fidgeted, stammered, glanced
      appealingly towards Frere for aid, and at last was obliged, between
      annoyance and an intense appreciation of the absurdity of his situation,
      to get up a fictitious cough, which, irritating the membrane of the nose,
      produced a most violent genuine sneeze. From the effects of this
      convulsion of nature he was relieved by a hearty slap on the back, while
      at the same moment the tones of a familiar voice exclaimed in his ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold, by all that&rsquo;s glorious! Bracy, my boy, how do you find yourself?&rdquo;
       and on looking up he recognised in the laughing face of the Addiscombe
      doctor, now divested of its spectacles, the well-known features of Charley
      Leicester.

      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;LEWIS FORFEITS THE RESPECT OF ALL POOR-LAW GUARDIANS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>qually surprised
      and mystified at the complete manner in which the tables had been turned
      upon him, Bracy stood listening with a disgusted expression of countenance
      to the peals of laughter which his discomfiture elicited from his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, laugh away,&rdquo; growled the victimised practical joker; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all very
      funny, I dare say, but one thing I&rsquo;ll swear in any court of justice, which
      is, that you have been talking real Persian, at least if what Frere
      jabbers is real Persian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have,&rdquo; returned Leicester, still in convulsions. &ldquo;When Frere
      and I planned this dodge we knew what a wide-awake gentleman we had to
      deal with, and took our measures accordingly. I learned four Persian
      sentences by heart from his dictation, and pretty good use I have made of
      them too, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not a bad idea, really,&rdquo; observed Bracy, who, having got over his
      annoyance at the first sense of defeat, instantly recovered his
      good-humour. &ldquo;How well you are got up! I did not recognise you one bit
      till you pulled off the barnacles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I got little Stevens, who does the light comic business at one of
      the minors, to provide the apparel and come and dress me. I hope you
      admire my complexion; he laid on the red and yellow most unsparingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has done it vastly well,&rdquo; returned Bracy. &ldquo;I shall cultivate that
      small man; he may be extremely useful to me on an occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we ought to be going upstairs,&rdquo; interrupted Frere; &ldquo;these waiter
      fellows are beginning to stare at us suspiciously too. I say, Bracy, cut
      it short, man; we have had all the fun now, and I&rsquo;m getting tired of the
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ya, Meinheer,&rdquo; rejoined Bracy aloud, adding in a lower tone, &ldquo;The slaveys
      will swallow that or anything else for Persian. They are all more or less
      drunk, by the fishy expression of their optics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura Peyton was astonished somewhat later in the evening by the
      Addiscombe professor leaning over the back of the sofa on which she was
      seated and asking whether she had enjoyed her last valse at Almack&rsquo;s the
      evening before last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you can feel no particular interest about such a frivolous and
      unintellectual matter, sir,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to follow up the inquiry by asking whether your partner made
      himself agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To which I shall reply, after the Irish fashion, by asking how it can
      possibly concern you to know, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely because I have the honour of the gentleman&rsquo;s acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, in fact, you are one of those uncommon characters who know
      themselves,&rdquo; returned Laura with an arch smile. &ldquo;Is not that what you wish
      to impress upon me, Mr. Leicester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley laughed, then continued in a lower tone, &ldquo;I saw you knew me. Did
      your own acuteness lead to the discovery, or are there traitors among us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend Mr. Arundel&rsquo;s expressive features let me into the secret of
      his acquaintance with the English language before we went down to supper;
      but I entered into a contract, not to betray the plot if he would tell me
      all I might wish to know about it, so the moment he came up I made him
      inform me who you were. What a gentlemanly, agreeable person he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she said this a slight shade passed across Leicester&rsquo;s good-natured
      countenance, and he replied, more quickly than was his wont&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had fancied Miss Peyton superior to the common feminine weakness of
      being caught by the last handsome face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a thoroughly <i>man</i>-like speech!&rdquo; returned the young lady. &ldquo;Did
      I say anything about his appearance, sir? Do you suppose we poor women are
      so utterly silly that we can appreciate nothing but a handsome face? Your
      professor&rsquo;s disguise has imbued you with the Turkish belief that women
      have no souls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one fortunate enough to be acquainted with Miss Peyton would continue
      long in such a heresy,&rdquo; replied Leicester, with the air of a man who
      thinks he is saying a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew you would make some such reply,&rdquo; returned Laura. &ldquo;You first
      show your real opinion of women by libelling the whole sex, and then try
      to get out of the scrape by insulting my understanding with a personal
      compliment. Wait,&rdquo; she continued, seeing he was about to defend himself,
      &ldquo;you must not talk to me any more now, or you will excite Lady Lombard&rsquo;s
      suspicions and betray the whole conspiracy. Go away, and send my new
      friend Mr. Arundel Hassan Bey here; Lady Lombard committed him to my
      charge, and I want to cultivate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leicester tried to assume a languishing look, which he was in the habit of
      practising upon young ladies with great success, but becoming suddenly
      conscious of the wig and spectacles, and gathering from Laura&rsquo;s silvery
      laugh that such adjuncts to an interesting expression of countenance were
      incongruous, not to say absurd, he joined in her merriment, then added,
      &ldquo;You are in a very wicked mood to-night, Miss Peyton; but I suppose I must
      e&rsquo;en do as you bid me, and reserve my revenge till some more fitting
      opportunity;&rdquo; then, mixing with the crowd, he sought out Lewis and
      delivered the young lady&rsquo;s message to him, adding in his usual drawling
      tone, &ldquo;You have made a what-do-ye-call-it&mdash;an impression in that
      quarter. Women always run after the last new face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; returned Lewis, with a degree of energy which startled
      his listless companion; &ldquo;and those men are wisest who know them for the
      toys they are, and avoid them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leicester gazed after his retreating figure in astonishment, then murmured
      to himself, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the wind now, I wonder; is the good youth trying to
      keep up the Asiatic character, or suddenly turned woman-hater? Confound
      that little Peyton girl, how sharp she was to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very well Mr. Leicester is disguised!&rdquo; observed Laura Peyton to
      Lewis, after they had conversed in German for some minutes on general
      topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lewis; &ldquo;though I can&rsquo;t say his appearance is improved by
      the alteration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fact of which he is fully aware,&rdquo; returned Laura, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause ensued, which was terminated by Laura&rsquo;s asking abruptly, &ldquo;Do
      gentlemen like Mr. Leicester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really I have not sufficient knowledge of facts to inform you, but I
      should say he is a very popular man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Popular man! I hate that phrase,&rdquo; returned his companion pettishly. &ldquo;It
      is almost as bad as describing any one as a man about town, which always
      gives me the idea of a creature that wears a pea-jacket, lives at a club,
      boards on cigars, talks slang, carries a betting-book, and never has its
      hair cut. Can&rsquo;t you tell me what you think of Mr. Leicester yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think him gentlemanly, good-natured, agreeable up to a certain
      point, cleverish&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ^ &ldquo;Yes, that will do; I quite understand. I don&rsquo;t think you do him justice&mdash;he
      has a kind heart, and more good sense than you are disposed to give him
      credit for. You should not form such hasty judgments of people; a want of
      charity I perceive is one of your faults. And now I must wish you
      good-night; I hear my kind old chaperone anxiously bleating after me in
      the distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying she arose and hastened to put herself under the protection of &ldquo;a
      fine old English gentlewoman,&rdquo; who, with a hooked nose, red gown, and
      green scarf, looked like some new and fearful variety of the genus
      Parroquet. At the same time, Bracy summoned Lewis to join the Prince, who
      was about to depart, which, after Lady Lombard had in an enthusiasm of
      gratitude uttered a whole sentence in the largest capitals, he was allowed
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester accompanied them, tearing himself away from Professor
      Malchapeau, who had singled him out as a brother savan, and commenced <i>raconte</i>-ing
      to him his affecting history, thereby leaving that shaggy little child of
      misfortune to lament to his sympathising hostess the melancholy fact that
      &ldquo;Zie Professor Addiscombe had cut his little tale off short, and
      transported himselfs avay in von great despatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Twere long to tell the jokes that were made, the new and
      additional matter brought to light, as each of the quartette, assembled
      round a second edition of supper in Bracy&rsquo;s rooms, detailed in turn his
      own personal experiences of the evening&rsquo;s comicalities&mdash;the cigars
      that were smoked, or the amount of sherry cobbler that was imbibed:
      suffice it to say, that a certain lyrical declaration that they would not
      &ldquo;go home till morning,&rdquo; to which, during their symposium, they had
      committed themselves, was verified when, on issuing out into the street,
      the cold grey light of early dawn threw its pale hue over their tired
      faces and struggled with sickly-looking gas lamps for the honour of
      illuminating the thoroughfares of the sleeping city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester&rsquo;s cab, with his night-horse&mdash;a useful animal, which,
      without a leg to stand upon, possessed the speed of the wind, and having
      every defect horseflesh is heir to, enjoyed a constitution which throve on
      exposure and want of sleep, as other organisations usually do on the exact
      opposites&mdash;was in waiting. Into this vehicle Charley (who bore some
      token of sherry cobbler in the unsteadiness of his gait), having made two
      bad shots at the step, rushed headlong and drove off at an insane pace,
      and in a succession of zigzags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frere and Lewis watched the cab till, having slightly assaulted an
      unoffending lamp-post, it flew round a corner and disappeared; then,
      having exchanged a significant glance suggestive of sympathetic
      anticipations of a sombre character in regard to the safety of their
      friend, they started at a brisk pace, which soon brought them to Frere&rsquo;s
      respectable dwelling. While the proprietor was searching in every pocket
      but the right one for that terror of all feeble-minded elders, that pet
      abomination of all fathers of families, that latest invention of the enemy
      of mankind&mdash;a latch-key&mdash;they were accosted by a lad of about
      fifteen, whose ragged clothes, bronzed features, and Murillo-like
      appearance accorded well with his supplication, &ldquo;<i>Per pietà Signor,
      denaro per un pover&rsquo; Italiano</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>

      <a href="images/0094.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Frere looked at him attentively, then exclaimed, &ldquo;I tell you what, boy, it
      won&rsquo;t do; you&rsquo;re no more an Italian than I am. You should not try to
      impose upon people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy hung down his head, and then replied doggedly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own
      fault; you&rsquo;ll let an English boy starve in the streets before you&rsquo;ll give
      him a bit of bread, but you are charitable enough to them foreign
      blackguards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; replied Frere. &ldquo;However, liar or not, you must be fed,
      I suppose; so if you choose to take a soup-ticket, here&rsquo;s one for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the boy proudly, &ldquo;you have called me liar, and I won&rsquo;t
      accept your miserable bounty. I&rsquo;d sooner starve first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; returned Frere, coolly pocketing the rejected ticket.
      &ldquo;Now have the goodness to take yourself off. Come, Lewis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you immediately,&rdquo; replied Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you shut the door after you, then,&rdquo; continued Frere, &ldquo;or we shall
      have that nice lad walking off with the silver spoons.&rdquo; So saying, he
      entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis waited till his retreating footsteps were no longer audible, then
      fixing his piercing glance upon the boy, he said in an impressive voice,
      &ldquo;Answer me truly, and I will give you assistance. Where did you learn to
      speak Italian with so good an accent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Naples, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I served on board a man-of-war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how have you fallen into this state of beggary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy hesitated for a moment, but something led him instinctively to
      feel that his confidence would not be abused, and he answered: &ldquo;When we
      got back to England and the crew were paid off I received £15. I got into
      bad company; they tempted me to everything that was wrong. My money was
      soon gone; I had no friends in London, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have applied to them
      after going on so bad if I&rsquo;d had any. I sold my clothes to buy bread; and
      when I had nothing left I begged, and lately I&rsquo;ve passed myself off as an
      Italian boy, because I found people more willing to give to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you like your present life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have to bear cold and hunger; and when people speak to me as <i>he</i>
      did just now it makes me feel wicked. Some day it will drive me mad, and I
      shall go and murder somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could buy some decent clothes, I&rsquo;d walk down to Portsmouth and try
      and get afloat again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would it cost to provide them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could rig myself out for a pound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis paused for a moment, then added quickly: &ldquo;Boy, I am poor and proud,
      as you are, therefore I can feel for you. Had I been exposed to
      temptation, friendless and untaught, I might have fallen as you have done.
      You have learnt a bitter lesson and may profit by it; it is in my power to
      afford you a chance of doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a card from his pocket and wrote upon it a few words in pencil,
      then handing it to the boy, continued: &ldquo;There is the direction to a friend
      of mine, the captain of a ship about to sail in a few days; show him my
      card, and tell him what you have told me. There is a sovereign to provide
      your dress, and five shillings to save you from begging or stealing till
      you get to Portsmouth; and when next you are tempted to sin remember its
      bitter fruits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he gave him the money. The boy received it mechanically, fixed
      his bright eyes for a moment on the face of his benefactor, and then,
      utterly overcome by such unexpected kindness, burst into a flood of tears.
      As Lewis turned to depart the first rays of the rising sun fell upon the
      tall, graceful figure of the young man and the tattered garments and
      emaciated form of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far different was the scene when Lewis Arundel and the creature he was
      thus rescuing from infamy met again upon the <i>RAILROAD OF LIFE!</i>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;IS CHIEFLY HORTICULTURAL, SHOWING THE EFFECTS PRODUCED
      BY TRAINING UPON A SWEET AND DELICATE ROSE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ose Arundel sat at
      the open window of her little bedroom and gazed out into the night. The
      scent of many flowers hung upon the loaded air, and the calm stars looked
      down from Heaven, contrasting their impassive grandeur with the unrest of
      this weary world. The evening had been lovely; not a breath of wind was
      stirring; the long shadows that slept upon the green sward, and afforded a
      dark background on which the brilliant glow-worms shone like diamonds on a
      funeral pall, were motionless; the silence, unbroken save when some heavy
      beetle or other strange insect of the night winged its drowsy way across
      the casement, was almost oppressive in its depth of stillness; it was a
      time and place for grave and earnest thought, a scene in which the full
      heart is conscious of its own sorrow. And Rose, although she had too much
      good sense and right principle to allow herself to feel miserable, was far
      from happy. The key to the inner life of every true-hearted woman must be
      sought in the affections. The only two people whom Rose had loved, as she
      was capable of loving, were her father and brother; for Mrs. Arundel,
      though all her impulses were kind and amiable, did not possess sufficient
      depth of character to inspire any very strong attachment. Between Captain
      Arundel and his daughter had existed one of those rare affections which
      appear so nearly to satisfy the cravings of our spiritual nature, that
      lest this world should become too dear to us they are blessings we are
      seldom permitted long to enjoy. Rose and her father were by nature much
      alike in disposition, and in forming her character, and educating and
      developing her mind, he had for some years found his chief interest, while
      in her affection lay his only solace for the blighted hopes and ruined
      prospects of a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally highly connected, Captain Arundel had incurred the displeasure
      of his family by forming in the heat of youthful passion, and under
      peculiar circumstances, a marriage with the daughter of an English
      resident at Marseilles by a foreign mother. Too proud to seek to
      conciliate his relations, Mr. Arundel became a voluntary exile, entered
      into the Austrian army, where he speedily rose to the rank of captain and
      served with much distinction, till failing health induced him to resign
      his commission and return to England for the sake of educating his
      children. His heart was set on one object&mdash;namely, to bestow upon his
      son the education of an English gentleman, and for this purpose he had
      availed himself of a very unusual talent for painting as a means by which
      he might increase his slender income sufficiently to meet the expenses of
      sending Lewis to Westminster and afterwards to a German university. The
      constant application thus rendered inevitable fostered the seeds of that
      most insidious of all ailments, a heart-disease, and while still forming
      plans for the welfare of his family, an unwonted agitation induced a
      paroxysm of his complaint, and ere Rose could realise the misfortune that
      threatened her she was fatherless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although stunned at first by the unexpected shock, hers was not a mind to
      give way at such a moment, and to those who judge by the outward
      expression only Mrs. Arundel&rsquo;s grief appeared much more intense than that
      of her daughter. But Rose&rsquo;s sorrow was not a mere transitory feeling,
      which a few weeks more or less might serve to dissipate; it had become
      part of her very nature, a thing too sacred to be lightly brought to view,
      but enshrined in the sanctuary of her pure heart it remained a cherished
      yet solemn recollection, which would shed its hallowing influence over the
      future of her young life. And now, as she sat with her calm, earnest eyes
      upturned to the tranquil heaven above her, her thoughts wandered back to
      him she had so dearly loved, and she pondered the solemn questions which
      have ere now presented themselves to many a mourning spirit, and longed to
      penetrate the secrets of the grave and learn things which death alone can
      teach us. Then she recalled conversations she had held with him that was
      gone on these very subjects, and remembered how he had said that the
      things which God had not seen fit to reveal, could neither be needful nor
      expedient for us to know; that such speculations were In themselves
      dangerous, inasmuch as they tended to lead us to form theories which,
      having no warrant in Scripture, might be at variance with truth; and that
      it was better to wait patiently in humble faith&mdash;that a time would
      come when we should no longer see through a glass darkly, and the hidden
      things of God should be made known unto us. Then her thoughts, still
      pursuing the same train, led her to reflect how all her father&rsquo;s
      aspirations, crushed and disappointed in the wreck of his own fortunes,
      had centred in his son, and the bitter tears which no personal privations
      or misfortunes could have forced from her, flowed down her cheeks as she
      reflected how these bright anticipations seemed doomed never to be
      realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unselfish by nature, and trained to habits of thoughtfulness by witnessing
      her father&rsquo;s life of daily self-sacrifice, Rose had never been accustomed
      to indulge on her own account in those day-dreams so common to the
      sanguine mind of youth. But the germs of that pride and ambition which
      were Lewis&rsquo;s besetting sins existed in a minor degree in Rose&rsquo;s
      disposition also, and found vent in a visionary career of greatness she
      had marked out for her brother, and for which his unusual mental powers
      and striking appearance seemed eminently to qualify him. In nourishing
      these visions her father had unconsciously assisted, when in moments of
      confidence he had imparted to her his hopes that Lewis would distinguish
      himself in whatever career of life he might select, and by his success
      restore them all to that position in society which by his own imprudence
      he had forfeited. What a bitter contrast did the reality now present! Rose
      had received that morning a letter from her brother detailing his
      interview with General Grant and its results; and though, from a wish to
      spare her feelings, he had been more guarded in his expressions than on
      the occasion of his conversation with Frere the preceding day, yet he did
      not attempt to disguise from her his repugnance to the arrangement, or the
      degradation to which his haughty spirit led him to consider he was
      submitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Lewis!&rdquo; murmured Rose, &ldquo;I know so well what misery it will be to
      him; the slights, the hourly petty annoyances which his proud, sensitive
      nature will feel so keenly; and then, to waste his high talents, his
      energy of character and strength of will on the drudgery of teaching, when
      they were certain to have led him to distinction if he had only had a fair
      field for their exercise&mdash;it would have broken dearest papa&rsquo;s heart,
      when he had hoped so differently for him. But if <i>he</i> had lived this
      never would have been so. He often told me he had influential friends, and
      though he never would apply to them on his own account, he declared he
      would do so when Lewis should become old enough to enter into life. I
      wonder who they were. He never liked to talk on those subjects, and I was
      afraid of paining him by inquiring. I am glad there is a Miss Grant: I
      hope she may prove a nice girl and will like Lewis; but of course she will&mdash;every
      one must do that. Oh! how I hope they will treat him kindly and generously&mdash;it
      will all depend upon that. Poor fellow! with his impulsive disposition and
      quick sense of wrong&mdash;his fiery temper too, how will he get on? And
      it is for our sakes he does all this, sacrificing his freedom and his
      hopes of winning himself a name. How good and noble it is of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and leaning her brow upon her little white hand, sat buried in
      deep thought. At length she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could do anything to earn money and help I should be so much
      happier. Poor papa got a good deal lately for his pictures; but they were
      so clever. Lewis can paint beautifully, but my drawings are so tame. I
      wonder whether people would buy poetry. I wish I knew whether my verses
      are good enough to induce any one to purchase them. Dearest papa praised
      those lines of mine which he accidentally found one day. Of course he was
      a good judge, only perhaps he liked them because they were mine.&rdquo; And the
      tears rolled silently down her pale cheeks as memory brought before her
      the glance of bright and surprised approval, the warm yet judicious
      praise, the tender criticism&mdash;words, looks, and tones of love now
      lost to her for ever, which the accidental discovery of her verses had
      drawn forth. With an aching heart she closed the casement, and lighting a
      candle, proceeded to unlock a small writing-desk, from whence she drew
      some manuscript verses, which ran as follows:&mdash;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose perused them attentively, sighed deeply, and then resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>he</i> liked them, and said (I remember his very words) there was
      more vigour and purpose about them than in the general run of girlish
      verses. How could I find out whether they are worth anything?&rdquo; She paused
      in reflection, then clasping her hands together suddenly, she exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, Mr. Frere; he was so good and kind about the pictures,
      and Lewis says he is so very clever, he will tell me. But may not he think
      it strange and odd in me to write to him? Had I better consult mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But with the question came an instinctive consciousness that she was about
      the last person whom it would be agreeable to consult on such an occasion.
      Rose, like every other woman possessing the slightest approach to the
      artist mind, felt a shrinking delicacy in regard to what the Browning
      school would term her &ldquo;utterances,&rdquo; which rendered the idea of showing
      them where they would not be appreciated exquisitely painful to her. Now,
      Mrs. Arundel had a disagreeable knack of occasionally brushing against a
      feeling so rudely as to cause the unlucky originator thereof to experience
      a mental twinge closely akin to the bodily sensation yclept toothache.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will therefore be no matter of surprise to the reader to learn that
      Rose, after mature deliberation, resolved to keep the fact of her having
      applied to Mr. Frere a secret, at all events till such time as the result
      should become known to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accordingly selected such of her poetical effusions as she deemed most
      worthy, in the course of which process she stumbled upon a short prose
      sketch, the only thing of the sort she had ever attempted, it being, in
      fact, a lively account of her first appearance at a dinner-party, written
      for the benefit of a young lady friend, but for some reason never sent.
      This, after looking at a page or two, she was about to condemn as
      nonsense, when an idea came across her that if Mr. Frere was to form a
      just estimate of her powers, it was scarcely fair to select only the best
      things; so she popped in the sketch of the dinner-party as a kind of
      destitution test, to show how badly she <i>could</i> write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the most difficult part of the business&mdash;the letter to
      Frere. True, she had written to him before, acting as her father&rsquo;s
      amanuensis, but that was a different sort of thing altogether. Still, it
      must be done, and Rose was not a person to be deterred by difficulties; so
      she took a sheet of paper and wrote &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; at the top of it, and having
      done so, sat and looked at it till she became intensely dissatisfied.
      &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;&mdash;it seemed so cold and uncomfortable; so she took a second
      sheet and wrote, &ldquo;Dear Sir.&rdquo; Yes! that was better, decidedly. She only
      hoped it was not too familiar in writing to a young man; but then, Mr.
      Frere was not exactly a young man; he was a great deal older than Lewis;
      above thirty most likely; and three or four-and-thirty was quite
      middle-aged; so the &ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo; was allowed to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ce n&rsquo;est que le premier pas qui coute?</i> and having once started, it
      was not long before Rose&rsquo;s nimble pen had covered two sides of the sheet
      of paper, and the following letter was the result:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;I know not how to offer any excuse for the trouble I am
      about to give you, otherwise than by explaining the reasons which have
      induced me to apply to you; and, as I know your time is valuable, I will
      do so as briefly as I can. Do not think me forgetful of, or ungrateful
      for, your great kindness to Lewis, when I tell you that ever since I
      received my brother&rsquo;s letter informing me of his engagement as tutor to
      General Grant&rsquo;s ward, I have felt miserable at the idea of his working
      hard at an occupation which I fear must be distasteful to him, in order to
      provide for Mamma and myself the comforts we have hitherto enjoyed. It was
      impossible to prevent this in any way, for we tried to shake his
      determination, but in vain. Now I feel that I should be so much happier if
      I could assist, in ever so small a degree, in relieving him from his
      burthen; and the only possible idea that occurs to me (for he will not
      hear of my going out as governess) is that I might be able to earn
      something by my pen. With this view I have ventured to enclose for your
      perusal a few verses which I have written at odd times for my own
      amusement; and I trust to your kindness to tell me honestly whether they
      possess any merit or not. I dare not hope your opinion will be favourable;
      but if by possibility it should prove so, will you do me the additional
      kindness of advising me what steps to take in order to get them published.
      I have never been in London, but I have heard there are a good many
      booksellers who live there; and as I dare say you know them all, perhaps
      you would kindly tell me to which of them you would recommend me to apply.
      I have not told Mamma that I am writing, for, as I feel a presentiment
      that your answer will only prove to me the folly of the hopes I am so
      silly as to indulge, it is not worth while disturbing her about the
      matter. Once again thanking you for your extreme kindness to Lewis, and
      hoping that you will not consider me too troublesome in thus applying to
      you, believe me to remain your sincerely obliged,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I have enclosed a little prose sketch with the verses, but I
      am <i>quite sure</i> you will not like that. Perhaps, if Lewis has not
      left you when this arrives, you will be so very kind as not to say any
      thing to him about it, as he would be sure to laugh at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Rose had finished this epistle she felt that she had done something
      towards attaining the object she had at heart, and went to bed feeling
      more happy than she had done since the receipt of Lewis&rsquo;s letter.
      Straightway falling asleep, she dreamt that she was introduced to Mr.
      Murray, who offered her £100 to write a short biographical memoir of
      General Grant for the &ldquo;Quarterly Review.&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Arundel,&mdash;I dare say you&rsquo;ve been abusing me like a
      pick-pocket; at least I must have appeared to you deserving of such abuse,
      for treating your request so cavalierly; but the fact is, I have been down
      in a Cornish tin mine for the last two days, and only received your packet
      on my arrival in town, an hour ago. And now to business. I don&rsquo;t set up
      for a judge of poetry, though I know what pleases me and what doesn&rsquo;t (I
      should be a donkey if I did not, you&rsquo;ll say); for instance, the present
      school of &lsquo;suggestive&rsquo; poetry doesn&rsquo;t suit me at all. But then I have an
      old-fashioned prejudice in favour of understanding what I read, and
      calling a railway locomotive a &lsquo;<i>resonant steam eagle</i>,&rsquo; for
      instance, does not tend to simplify literature; the only thing such
      phrases &lsquo;suggest&rsquo; to me is that it would be a great deal better if the
      authors were content to stick to plain English, and when they have such
      inexpressibly grand ideas, not to trouble themselves to express them at
      all. Your verses have at least one good point in them&mdash;they are so
      worded that a plain man may understand them; in fact, all that I have yet
      read I like&mdash;the feeling is invariably pure, true, and beautiful
      (your heart&rsquo;s in the right place, and no mistake); the language is well
      chosen, and sometimes eloquent; there are, of course, plenty of places
      where it becomes weak and young lady-like, but that was only to be
      expected. We can&rsquo;t all be men, unfortunately. I could not help laughing
      when you &lsquo;supposed I knew&rsquo; all the booksellers and publishers in London,
      Heaven forbid! for in that case I should have a very miscellaneous
      acquaintance. However, I do know several, and I will go the first thing
      to-morrow morning and consult one of them&mdash;a gentleman on whose
      judgment I can rely as to what will be the most advisable course for us to
      pursue. I say <i>us</i>, because, as I don&rsquo;t mean to let the matter rest
      till I have succeeded, I consider myself a partner in the concern. Lewis
      parted from me in high health and very tolerable spirits. He left town,
      with General Grant, the same morning on which I started for Cornwall. You
      shall hear from me again when I can report progress. Don&rsquo;t write any more
      nonsense about giving me trouble: in the first place, the thing is no
      trouble; in the second, I should not mind it one bit if it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am yours very truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Frere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first thing next morning Frere called upon his friend the publisher,
      who, as soon as he understood that nothing beyond advice was required of
      him, became very communicative and agreeable; glanced his eye over the
      verses and approved of them, though he added, with a Burleigh-like shake
      of the head, that he wished they were anything but poetry. Frere wondered
      why, and asked him. In reply he learned that the public mind had acquired
      a sadly practical bias, which leading him to suggest that poetry was the
      very thing of all others to bring it right again, he was further informed
      that the evil was much too deeply seated to be affected by so weak an
      application as the poetry of the present day; and the truth of this
      assertion appearing undeniable, the subject was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing for you to do with these MSS., Mr. Frere,&rdquo; continued his
      adviser, &ldquo;would be to get them inserted in some popular periodical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t object,&rdquo; returned Frere. &ldquo;Which had I better send them to?
      There&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gently&rsquo;s Miscellany,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;New Weekly,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Gainsworth&rsquo;s
      Magazine,&rsquo; and half-a-dozen more of&rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose would be the result of adopting such a line of
      conduct?&rdquo; inquired his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as the things are in themselves good, they&rsquo;d probably put &rsquo;em
      in next month, and send a cheque for the amount, enclosed in a polite note
      asking for more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;A very promising young friend of mine sent
      a nicely written paper to the least exclusive of the periodicals you have
      just mentioned; hearing nothing of it, he ventured at the end of six
      months to write and inquire its fate. In reply he received a note from the
      editor, which appeared to him more explicit than satisfactory. It was
      couched in the following laconic terms:&mdash;&lsquo;Declined with thanks.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phewl that&rsquo;s pleasant,&rdquo; rejoined Frere. &ldquo;What would you advise, then,
      under the circumstances? I place myself quite in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend leaned back in his chair and considered the matter deeply. At
      length he seemed to have hit upon some expedient, for he muttered with
      great emphasis, &ldquo;Yes, that might do. He could if he would. Yes&mdash;certainly!&rdquo;
       Then turning suddenly to Frere, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Mind, you&rsquo;ll never breathe
      a word of it to any living being!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the world,&rdquo; returned Frere. &ldquo;And now, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of &lsquo;Blunt&rsquo;s Magazine&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve seen it in several places lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt; it&rsquo;s a most admirably conducted publication, and one which is
      certain to become a great favourite with the public. Now I happen to be
      acquainted with one of the gentlemen who edit it, and shall be happy to
      give you a note of introduction to him. But you must promise me to be most
      careful never to reveal his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; rejoined Frere, &ldquo;if you wish it. But may I venture to ask
      what it would signify if all London knew it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion turned upon him a look of indignant surprise; but perceiving
      that he made the inquiry in honest simplicity of heart, his face assumed
      an expression of contemptuous pity as he replied, in such a tone of voice
      as one would use to a little child who had inquired why it might not set
      light to a barrel of gunpowder, &ldquo;My dear sir, you do not know&mdash;you
      cannot conceive the consequences. Such a thing would be utterly
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then wrote a few lines, which he handed to Frere, saying, &ldquo;You will
      find him at home till eleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this mysterious name,&rdquo; observed Frere, glancing at the address, &ldquo;is!&mdash;eh!
      nonsense!&mdash;Thomas Bracy, Esq. Why, he is an intimate friend of my
      own! That&rsquo;s famous. Oh! I&rsquo;ll have some fun with him. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m
      extremely obliged to you; good morning.&rdquo; So saying Frere seized his hat,
      shouldered his umbrella, and hurried off, overjoyed at his discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mendacious tiger, of whom we have already made honourable mention,
      answered Frere&rsquo;s inquiry as to whether his master was at home with a most
      decided and unequivocal negative, adding the gratuitous information that,
      &ldquo;he had gone down to dine with his uncle at Hampstead the previous day and
      was not expected home till four o&rsquo;clock that afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a nuisance,&rdquo; returned Frere. &ldquo;I tell you what, boy, I&rsquo;ll
      step in and write your master a note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, certainly, if you please, sir; only we&rsquo;ve been a having the
      sweeps hin, and the place is hall in a huproar, so as it&rsquo;s unpossibul to
      touch nothink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a bell rung violently, and the boy, begging Frere to wait,
      bounded up the stairs with a cat-like rapidity, returning almost
      immediately with the information that &ldquo;He was wery sorry, but he&rsquo;d just
      been to the greengrocer&rsquo;s, and while he was hout master had comed home
      quite promiscuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about the soot?&rdquo; asked Frere, a light breaking in upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, cook&rsquo;s been and cleaned it hup while I were gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a nice boy!&rdquo; Then catching him by
      the collar of his jacket, he continued, &ldquo;Tell me, you young scamp, how
      often do you speak the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The urchin, thus detected, glanced at Frere&rsquo;s face, and reading there that
      any attempt to keep up appearances must prove a dead failure, replied with
      the utmost <i>sang froid,</i> &ldquo;Please, sir, whenever I can&rsquo;t think of
      nothink better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an answer,&rdquo; returned Frere meditatively. &ldquo;Well, you need never
      learn swimming&mdash;water won&rsquo;t harm you; but mark my words, and beware
      of hemp.&rdquo; So saying he loosened his hold on the boy&rsquo;s collar and followed
      him upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tiger, not having recognised Frere in his European habiliments, had
      merely told his master that a gentleman wished to see him on business; and
      Bracy, who had reason to expect a visit from a certain literary Don, had
      rushed into his dressing-room to exchange a very decidedly &ldquo;fast&rdquo;
       smoking-jacket for the black frock-coat of editorial propriety; for which
      reason Frere was left to entertain himself for a few minutes with his own
      society. After examining sundry clever caricature sketches of Bracy&rsquo;s,
      which evinced a decided talent for that branch of art, Frere seated
      himself in an easy-chair in front of a writing-table on which lay a
      mysterious document, written in a bold, dashing hand, which involuntarily
      attracted his attention. Perceiving at a glance that it contained no
      private matter, he amused himself by perusing it. For the reader&rsquo;s
      edification we will transcribe it:&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;CONTAINS A DISQUISITION ON MODERN POETRY, AND AFFORDS
      THE READER A PEEP BEHIND THE EDITORIAL CURTAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he position in
      which Frere had placed himself prevented Bracy from discerning his
      features as he entered, and he accordingly accosted his visitor as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I am really distressed to have kept you waiting, but as you
      arrived I was just jotting down the result of a little flirtation with the
      Muse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is it, I suppose?&rdquo; observed Frere, turning his face towards the
      speaker and pointing to the document before alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Frere, is it you, man?&rdquo; exclaimed Bracy in surprise. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;m a
      sinner, I took you for that learned elder, Dr.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-. My
      young imp told me you were a gentleman who wished to see me on particular
      business. If that juvenile devil takes to telling lies <i>to</i> instead
      of <i>for</i> me, I shall have to give him his due for once, in the shape
      of a sound caning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may spare yourself the trouble,&rdquo; returned Frere, &ldquo;as by some accident
      he has only spoken the truth this time; for I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to
      insinuate that I am anything but a gentleman, and I have most assuredly
      come to you on business&mdash;that is, always supposing Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Street has informed me correctly in regard
      to your editorial functions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! has the <i>cacoethes scribendi</i> seized you also, and tempted you
      into the commission of some little act of light literature?&rdquo; added Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness, no,&rdquo; answered Frere. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to say I&rsquo;m not so far
      gone as all that comes to yet. No, this is a different case altogether,&rdquo;
       and he then proceeded to inform his companion of Rose&rsquo;s, application, and
      the necessity which existed to make her talents available for practical
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magazine writing affords rather a shady prospect for realising capital in
      these days,&rdquo; observed Bracy, shaking his head discouragingly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look
      at the young lady&rsquo;s interesting efforts. Have you ever seen her? Arundel&rsquo;s
      sister ought to be pretty. What&rsquo;s this? &lsquo;The Preacher&rsquo;s Address to the
      Soul.&rsquo; Why, it&rsquo;s a sermon in rhyme. Heaven help the girl! what&rsquo;s she
      thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it and you&rsquo;ll see. I like it very much,&rdquo; returned Frere, slightly
      nettled at the reception his <i>protégées</i> productions appeared likely
      to meet with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s a sermon clearly,&rdquo; continued Bracy; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s something about
      vanity and the grave. I heard it all last Sunday at St. Chrysostom&rsquo;s, only
      the fellow called it gwave and gwace. He&rsquo;d picked up some conscientious
      scruple against the use of the letter R, I suppose. It&rsquo;s quite wonderful,
      the new-fangled doctrines they develop nowadays. Hum&mdash;ha&mdash;&lsquo;Making
      the desert home,&rsquo;&mdash;rather a young idea, eh? &lsquo;Happy birds,&rsquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      like that, it puts one too much in mind of &lsquo;jolly dogs&rsquo; or &lsquo;odd fish.&rsquo; I
      should have said dicky birds, if it had been me; that&rsquo;s a very safe
      expression, and one that people are accustomed to. &lsquo;The joy of flowers,&rsquo;&mdash;what
      on earth does she mean by that, now? I should say nobody could understand
      that; for which reason, by the way, it&rsquo;s the best expression I&rsquo;ve seen
      yet. Poetry, to be admired in the present day, must be utterly
      incomprehensible. We insert very little, but that&rsquo;s the rule I go by. If I
      can&rsquo;t understand one word of a thing, I make a point of accepting it; it&rsquo;s
      safe to become popular. &lsquo;Love for time, Heaven for eternity,&rsquo;&mdash;well,
      that&rsquo;s all very, nice and pretty, but I&rsquo;m sorry to say it won&rsquo;t do; it&rsquo;s
      not suited to the tone of the Magazine, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I <i>do</i> see very clearly at present,&rdquo; returned Frere;
      &ldquo;what kind of poetry is it that you accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there are different styles. Now here&rsquo;s a little thing I&rsquo;ve got in the
      June part, &lsquo;The Homeless Heart, by L. O. V. E.&rsquo; Her real name is Mary
      Dobbs, but she couldn&rsquo;t very well sign herself M.D.; people would think
      she was a physician. She&rsquo;s a very respectable young woman (such a girl to
      laugh), and engaged to an opulent stockbroker. Now listen:

      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a question I can&rsquo;t take upon myself to answer,&rdquo; interrupted Frere.
      &ldquo;But if those are in the style you consider suited to the tone of your
      Magazine, it must be a very wonderful publication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I flatter myself it is, rather,&rdquo; replied Bracy complacently. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s
      by no means the only style; here&rsquo;s a thing that will go down with the
      million sweetly. Listen to this,&rdquo; and as he spoke he extracted from a
      drawer a mighty bundle of papers labelled &ldquo;Accepted Poetry,&rdquo; and selecting
      one or two specimens from the mass, read as follows:&mdash;

      spare me the infliction of those detestable compound adjectives.&rdquo;

    <p class="indent20">
      While all nature was a-maying,
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      On a sunny bank I lay;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Where the happy grass did grow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &lsquo;Neath the fragrant lime-tree row,

    <p class="indent25">

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; inquired Bracy, interrupting
      himself on seeing Frere snatch up his hat and umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to read any more of that, I&rsquo;m off; that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; returned
      Frere. &ldquo;My powers of endurance are limited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you are positively such a Hottentot as to dislike it,&rdquo; rejoined
      Bracy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not waste any more of its sweet simplicity upon you; but,
      you&rsquo;ll see, the gentle public will rave about it to an immense extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me honestly, Bracy&mdash;you don&rsquo;t really admire that childish
      rubbish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, Bracy&rsquo;s face assumed an expression of most comical
      significance; and after pausing for a moment in indecision, he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve a sort of respect for your good opinion, Frere, and I don&rsquo;t
      exactly like to send you away fancying me a greater ass than I am; so I&rsquo;ll
      honestly confess that, what between affected Germanisms on the one hand
      and the puerilities of the Wordsworth-and-water school on the other, the
      poetry of the present day has sunk to a very low ebb indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t you consider it the duty of every honest critic to point this
      out, and so guide and reform the public taste as to evoke from the &lsquo;well
      of English undefiled&rsquo; a truer and purer style?&rdquo; returned Frere earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, that all sounds very well in theory, but in practice, I&rsquo;m
      afraid (to use a metaphor derived from one of the humane and intellectual
      amusements of our venerated forefathers), that cock won&rsquo;t fight. It may be
      all very well for some literary Don Quixote, with a pure Saxon taste and a
      long purse, to tilt at the public&rsquo;s pet windmills, because he conceives
      them to be giant abuses. If he meets with a fall, he need only put his
      hand in his pocket and purchase a plaster, getting a triple shield of
      experience in for the money. But it is far otherwise with a magazine. If
      that is to continue in existence it must pay; in order to pay it must be
      rendered popular; to make a thing popular you must go with the stream of
      public opinion, and not against it. The only chance is to head the tide
      and turn it in the direction you desire. But to attempt that a man ought
      to possess first-rate talent, and I&rsquo;m free to confess that I, for one, do
      not; and therefore, you see, as people must be amused, I&rsquo;m very willing to
      amuse them in their own way, as long as I find it pleasant and profitable
      to do so. <i>Voila!</i> do you comprehend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I comprehend this much,&rdquo; returned Frere gruffly, &ldquo;that the ground of your
      argument is expediency and not principle; and I tell you plainly that does
      not suit me, and I&rsquo;m afraid Miss Arundel is too much of my mind in that
      particular for her writings to suit your wonderful magazine; so the sooner
      I take my departure the better for your morning&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a moment, don&rsquo;t get on stilts, man,&rdquo; returned Bracy, resuming his
      examination of Rose&rsquo;s papers. &ldquo;Is there nothing but verses? What have we
      here? &lsquo;My First Dinner-Party&rsquo;&mdash;this seems more likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and ran his eye over several of the pages, muttering from time
      to time as he went along, &ldquo;Yes, good lively style&mdash;quick powers of
      observation&mdash;a very graphic touch&mdash;bravo! ha! ha! here, listen
      to this&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Immediately before me stood a dish which even my inexperience believed
      itself able to recognise; it was jelly of some kind, with certain dark
      objects encased in it, as flies occasionally are in amber. These opaque
      portions I settled, in my own mind, must be preserved fruit, and
      accordingly (fearful lest, in my ignorance of fashionable dishes, I should
      say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to some tremendous delicacy which might prove utterly
      impracticable), when invited to partake of it, I graciously signified my
      assent. Imagine my horror when, on putting the first mouthful to my lips,
      I discovered the jelly was savoury&mdash;<i>i.e</i>. all pepper and salt,
      and the creature embedded in it a fragment of some dreadful fish! Eating
      the thing was out of the question; the mere taste I had taken of it made
      me feel uncomfortable: an attempt to conceal it beneath the knife and fork
      proved utterly futile. I glanced at the butler, but he was too much
      absorbed in his own dignity and the dispensation of champagne to observe
      me; I gazed appealingly at a good-looking young footman, but he merely
      pulled up his shirt-collar foppishly, thinking he had made an impression;
      I even ventured to call, in a low voice, to the sprightly waiter who had
      eloped with my untouched plate of lamb five minutes before, but he did not
      hear me; and there I sat with a huge plateful of horrible food before me,
      which I could neither eat nor get rid of, &ldquo;a cynosure for neighbouring
      eyes,&rdquo; forced, as my fears suggested, to run the gauntlet of all the
      mocking glances of the assembled company.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; continued Bracy, &ldquo;I call that a stunning description; I could not
      have done it better myself. The girl writes so easily! Let me see, 18&mdash;25&mdash;28
      lines in a page of manuscript; there&rsquo;s not much of it, I think I can get
      it in. I want two pages of amusing matter in the fourth sheet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahl something light, about two. Now I understand,&rdquo; exclaimed Frere,
      pointing to the mysterious document on the table; &ldquo;that was not a
      memorandum in regard to luncheon, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo; returned Bracy, shouting with laughter. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he continued, as
      soon as he had in some measure recovered his composure, &ldquo;that is the
      &lsquo;make-up,&rsquo; as we call it, of the third and fourth sheets of the Magazine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; returned Frere. &ldquo;I should think it must require a great deal of
      careful reflection to select suitable articles and arrange them properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! no, not a bit; the thing&rsquo;s simple enough when you once get in the way
      of it. Have plenty of variety, that&rsquo;s the grand point&mdash;what one
      doesn&rsquo;t like, another will. Take large shot for big birds, and small shot
      for little ones, and then you&rsquo;ll bag the whole covey; that&rsquo;s my maxim.
      Now, look here: first we begin with a scientific article, &lsquo;Questions on
      Quicksilver.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s not one reader in a hundred that can understand that
      paper when they&rsquo;ve read it; and very few even of those who can take it in
      care two straws about quicksilver&mdash;why should they? But they all read
      it, because it&rsquo;s a cheap way of getting up the necessary amount of
      scientific jargon to hash into small talk. I never look at that man&rsquo;s
      papers myself; I know they&rsquo;re safe, though I can&rsquo;t understand a word of &rsquo;em&mdash;but
      they&rsquo;re a great help to the Magazine. Then comes our friend, the &lsquo;Homeless
      Heart.&rsquo; I put that in as a drop of romantic barley-sugar to soften the
      women&rsquo;s throats after swallowing the science. Next we have &lsquo;An Historical
      Parallel.&rsquo; Famous fellows they are; the principal dodge in writing them is
      to take an &lsquo;entirely new reading of the character,&rsquo; as the actors say. In
      the present article, if I recollect right, they prove Cour-de-Lion to have
      been a hypocritical fanatic, and Cromwell a chivalric, magnanimous
      enthusiast. It&rsquo;s safe to take, depend upon it. &lsquo;L&rsquo;Incomprise&rsquo; tells its
      own tale&mdash;it&rsquo;s as close an imitation of Eugene Sue and George Sand as
      English morality will tolerate, though the invention of guttapercha, or
      some other elastic agent, enables even that stiff material nowadays to
      stretch to lengths which would astonish our grandmothers. Then comes the
      &lsquo;Plea for the Industrial Classes&rsquo;&mdash;a regular savage poke at the
      present Poor Law (we&rsquo;re obliged to do a little bit of political economy as
      well as our neighbours, you know); it&rsquo;s awfully heavy, but it will
      neutralise any ill effects &lsquo;L&rsquo;Incomprise&rsquo; may have had on fathers of
      families all the better. Lastly, there&rsquo;s my own little thing, &lsquo;Dog-cart
      Drives.&rsquo; Ahem! have you seen that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Frere; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time for reading tra&mdash;&mdash; I mean
      novels and that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s liked; I hear it&rsquo;s a good deal talked about,&rdquo; continued
      Bracy with an air of bashful self-complacency. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bell&rsquo;s Life&rsquo; spoke very
      handsomely of it last week; there were six whole lines devoted to it, I
      think. Upon my word I should like you to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Frere suddenly discovered that he had remained over his
      time, and should be too late for some deeply interesting experiments that
      were to come off that morning at what his companion termed his science
      shop; so receiving an assurance from Bracy that Rose&rsquo;s sketch should be
      inserted in the Magazine, and that he would consider what would be her
      best mode of proceeding in regard to the poetry, the friends shook hands
      and parted, Frere promising to make himself acquainted with the
      subject-matter of &ldquo;Dog-cart Drives&rdquo; at an early opportunity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;MISS LIVINGSTONE SPEAKS A BIT OF HER MIND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a lovely morning in early summer, when the sun, shining into
      Lewis&rsquo;s bedroom at Broadhurst, aroused him from a heavy dreamless
      ===sleep, the result of his previous night&rsquo;s dissipation at Lady
      Lombard&rsquo;s. The sensation of waking for the first time in a strange place
      is usually a disagreeable one; there is an unfamiliar newness in the
      aspect of everything around us, an absence of old associations, which to
      an impressible disposition is singularly disheartening. This was
      peculiarly the case with Lewis; the costly furniture of the room, arranged
      with a stiff propriety, the spotless carpet, the chair-covers too clean
      and slippery to be sat upon, the bright cold mirrors, the polished grate,
      in which a fire would have been high treason, each and all suggestive of
      the chilling influence of that rigid disciplinarian Miss Livingstone,
      served painfully to realise his new position. Splendour without comfort
      was an anomaly he had never before encountered, and in his then frame of
      mind it aroused all the bitter feelings which even his strength of will
      was unable to subdue, and he mentally compared himself to a slave working
      in gilded chains, and longed for independence, no matter through what
      hardships, struggles, and dangers it must be attained. But there was a
      healthy energy about his mind which prevented his yielding to these morbid
      feelings; hastily dressing himself, he found his way into the pleasure
      garden, and as it was yet early, strolled onward through the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      After wandering about for nearly an hour, the calm beauty of the scenery
      and the exhilarating freshness of the morning air producing their natural
      effect upon his spirits, it occurred to him that his absence might be
      commented upon, and possibly give offence; accordingly, he retraced his
      steps towards the house. Ignorant of the <i>locale</i>, however, he was
      unable to discover the door by which he had gone out, and after making one
      or two attempts in a wrong direction, was compelled to effect his entrance
      through a French window opening into a conservatory. Lewis possessed a
      great taste for, and some knowledge of botany, and his attention was at
      once attracted by the rare and beautiful plants around him. So completely
      was he engrossed by his admiration, that not until he heard his own name
      pronounced did he become aware that he was not the sole tenant of the
      conservatory. Turning at the sound, he perceived Annie Grant, in a very
      becoming costume, busily employed in altering the arrangement of certain
      flower-pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we proceed farther, it may be as well to afford the reader an
      insight into Lewis&rsquo;s feelings towards this young lady, as they were by no
      means of such a nature as might be expected from a young man towards a
      pretty and agreeable girl, with whom he was about to be domesticated. In
      order to account for his peculiar state of mind on this subject we must
      take a retrospective glance at an episode in Lewis&rsquo;s student life, which
      has been already alluded to in a conversation between Frere and his
      friend. About a year before the period at which our story opened Lewis had
      encountered, at a festive meeting of the worthy citizens of Bonn, the very
      pretty daughter of a wealthy shopkeeper, and struck by her bright eyes and
      a certain naïve simplicity of manner, had danced with her the greater part
      of the evening. Flattered by the attentions of the handsome young
      Englishman, the damsel, who (her simplicity being confined entirely to
      manner) was as arrant a little flirt as ever caused a heartache, took care
      that the acquaintance should continue; and while she was merely bent on
      adding to her train of admirers, Lewis fell in love with her as deeply as
      a man can do with a girl completely his inferior in mind as well as in
      station. Imagination, however, which at eighteen is alarmingly active,
      supplied all deficiencies, and Lewis continued to dream his lady-love was
      an angel, till one fine morning the fact of her elopement with a young
      German baron, who looked upon matrimony as a superfluous ordinance,
      induced him to alter his opinion. With the termination of the adventure
      the reader is already acquainted, but the effect upon Lewis&rsquo;s disposition
      was one which time might weaken but could never efface. The fatal lesson
      that one who seemed true and pure was not so, once learnt could never be
      forgotten; the seeds of mistrust were sown, and strive as he might, the
      perfect faith, the bright, eager confidence of youth, were lost to him for
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ànnie, as the reader is aware, was unusually lovely, and Lewis accordingly
      regarded her in the light of a dangerous man-trap; besides this, oddly
      enough, she was by no means unlike an ethereal and spiritualised
      representation of &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo;; the features and colouring were similar, and
      the arch simplicity of the <i>Fraulein&rsquo;s</i> manner was part and parcel of
      Annie&rsquo;s very nature. The painful recollections which this resemblance
      excited added unconsciously to the prejudice (for it amounted to that)
      which Lewis had conceived against the General&rsquo;s daughter; but the true
      source of the feeling lay deeper. However circumstances may cause him to
      affect, or even to believe the contrary, there is in every man&rsquo;s heart a
      latent desire to render himself agreeable to any young and pretty woman
      into whose society he may be thrown, more especially where the individual
      is conscious of possessing powers of pleasing if he chooses to exert them;
      and even Lewis&rsquo;s slight experience of society had sufficed to enlighten
      him in regard to this point, on which the dullest are usually
      clear-sighted. But coupled with this feeling came the humiliating
      consciousness that although by birth and education Miss Grant&rsquo;s equal, the
      position he held in the family rendered him her inferior; and this idea
      was galling in the extreme to Lewis&rsquo;s haughty nature. Annie, on the other
      hand, profoundly ignorant of all these wheels within wheels, entertained
      the most amiable and benevolent intentions towards her new associate. She
      knew he was unfortunate, she saw he was a gentleman, and she had heard
      that he was undertaking a duty he disliked, for the sake of his mother and
      sister; and for all these reasons her woman&rsquo;s heart warmed towards him,
      and she determined to do what she was able to render his position as
      little painful as might be; moreover, she was sufficiently acquainted with
      the idiosyncrasies of her father and great-aunt to be aware that any
      particular kindness the young tutor would be likely to meet with in the
      family must emanate from herself. Accordingly, when Lewis, having replied
      to her cordial &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; by slightly raising his hat,
      and making a formal bow, was about to pass on, she renewed the attack by
      adding&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I trouble you to move this flower-pot for me? it is so heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, Lewis stopped short, and for a moment debated with
      himself the possibility of refusing; but without being actually ill-bred,
      such a possibility did not exist; so, resigning himself to his fate with a
      very ill grace, he deposited his hat on a vacant flower-stand, and tossing
      back his dark curls with the air of a sulky lion shaking his mane, he took
      the garden-pot, which indeed seemed too heavy for Annie&rsquo;s little hands,
      asking, with a stately coldness by no means in character with the mild
      nature of the inquiry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where would you wish to have it placed, Miss Grant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, if you will be so kind,&rdquo; returned the young lady, indicating the
      spot by pointing with the end of a pert little parasol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, having installed the plant in its appointed place, was again about
      to take his departure, but ere he did so, glancing involuntarily at the
      effect of his labour, his quick eye at once discerned the object of the
      changes Annie was striving to effect, and perceived that, in&rsquo; order to
      carry out her design, several heavy flowers yet required moving. Nothing,
      however, was farther from his thoughts than the idea of volunteering his
      assistance, when Annie, catching the direction of his eye, continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the White Camellia is too low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While the Rhododendron is as much too high,&rdquo; returned Lewis eagerly, and
      forgetting his proud scruples in the impulse of the moment, he set to work
      with the greatest energy to complete the arrangement which his correct
      taste acknowledged to be an improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Camellia had been exalted and the Rhododendron abased, and many other
      &ldquo;pets of the parterre&rdquo; had experienced sudden changes of position, and
      still Lewis worked with unabated zeal, and still his fair companion
      directed and approved, when just as, poised like a flying Mercury on one
      foot half-way up a high flower-stand, he was stretching to his utmost to
      install a gaudy Cactus, all red and green like a paroquet, on the topmost
      pinnacle, a stately tread was heard approaching, and General Grant entered
      the conservatory. Lewis coloured with mingled anger and annoyance at being
      detected in such a situation, but Annie good-naturedly came to his
      assistance. Tripping up to her father and taking both his hands, she
      exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, papa. Welcome to dear old Broadhurst once again. How pretty
      it all looks! But they have placed my flowers so stupidly, I must have
      every one of them altered. I&rsquo;ve been working away for half-an-hour at
      least, and as Mr. Arundel happened to be passing, I pressed him into the
      service, for some of the pots are so heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much too heavy for you to attempt to move, my dear,&rdquo; returned the General
      in a tone of marked disapproval; &ldquo;but why did you not summon one of the
      gardeners to make the alteration you wished, without troubling Mr.
      Arundel, who must have had other duties to perform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it was your desire, sir, to be present at my introduction to my future
      pupil,&rdquo; replied Lewis, who had by this time reached <i>terra firma</i> and
      recovered his self-possession, &ldquo;I have refrained from making any attempt
      to see him till I should have learned your further wishes on the subject.
      My time was therefore quite at Miss Grant&rsquo;s disposal, if I could be in any
      way useful to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter is obliged by your politeness, sir, but will not trespass
      upon it further,&rdquo; replied the General coldly. &ldquo;My dear Annie,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;it only wants ten minutes to nine; you will oblige me by
      preparing for breakfast. Punctuality is a quality by the neglect of which
      all order is subverted, propriety set at nought, much valuable time wasted
      which can never be recalled, and the comfort of a family totally
      destroyed. Your excellent aunt is aware of my opinion on this subject, and
      during the twelve years she has done me the favour to preside over my
      household she has never kept me waiting one minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, dear papa, I&rsquo;ll do my best to please you,&rdquo; returned Annie; &ldquo;but,&rdquo;
       she added, laying her hand on-his shoulder caressingly, and looking up in
      his face with a glance half mischievous and half imploring, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t
      expect me to be so terribly perfect as Aunt Martha? Recollect, she is
      three times as old as I am, and ought therefore to be three times as
      wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General tried to look displeased, but he could not resist Annie for he
      was human after all; so, stroking her glossy curls, he told her that Mrs.
      Botherfille (a serious schoolmistress, who, for the trifling consideration
      of £300 per annum, condescended to allow the youthful female aristocracy
      of the land to sit at her feet and learn from her lips how to regenerate
      society through the medium of frivolous accomplishments) had failed in
      curing her of talking nonsense, at which Annie laughed merrily and then
      tripped off, turning as she passed Lewis to take a last glance at the
      newly-arranged flowers, and saying, &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t they look pretty, Mr.
      Arundel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the directions in regard to Lewis and his pupil&rsquo;s separate
      establishment (for such the isolated suite of rooms they were to occupy
      might be considered) had not as yet been communicated to the servants,
      General Grant requested the favour of Lewis&rsquo;s company at breakfast with as
      much ceremony as he could have used if he had been inviting a royal duke
      to a banquet; and as a request from such a quarter was equivalent to a
      command, Lewis could only comply. Half a minute before the clock struck
      nine, Miss Livingstone, that human hedge-hog, rustled into the
      breakfast-room, more stiff and starched in mind and body than any other
      living creature. As for her cap, a railway train might have passed over it
      without injuring that rigid mystery, while her gown was at the least
      sabre, not to say bullet-proof. If ever there were a wife fitted for our
      Iron Duke, that adamantine spinster was the woman&mdash;only that to have
      married her would have required more courage than twenty Waterloos!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock struck nine the household servants made their appearance, and
      all the family knelt down (with the exception of Miss Livingstone, who,
      being evidently fashioned as the ancients believed elephants to be,
      without knee-joints, merely reared up against the breakfast-table, as the
      next best thing she could do), while the General read them a short, sharp,
      but polite prayer, after which he blessed them very much as if he were
      doing the reverse, and suffered them to depart. The breakfast was
      excellent as far as the commissariat department was concerned, and the tea
      was not so cold as might have been expected considering that Miss
      Livingstone poured it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Lewis&rsquo;s short acquaintance with that austere virgin&rsquo;s usual
      expression of countenance led him to believe that a darker shade than
      ordinary lowered upon her brow; nor was he mistaken, for after despatching
      a piece of dry toast with the air of an acidulated martyr, the spirit (we
      fear it was not an amiable one) moved her, and she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say, General, your benevolence has rather overpowered your
      judgment, to my poor thinking, in this singular addition to the
      establishment at Broadhurst. I really consider that I ought to have been a
      little more clearly informed as to the facts of the case before these new
      arrangements were actually decided on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you refer to Sir Walter Desborough, madam,&rdquo; returned the General
      sternly, &ldquo;I must recall to your memory the fact of my having mentioned to
      you, this day week, my intention that my ward should reside at
      Broadhurst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the habit of forgetting any communication you do me the
      honour of making to me, General Grant, nor have I forgotten the
      conversation to which you refer; but if you mentioned that your ward was a
      dangerous idiot, and that you expected me to preside over a private
      lunatic asylum, that circumstance certainly has escaped me.&rdquo; The wrinkles
      on the General&rsquo;s forehead deepened as he replied with a glance towards
      Lewis, &ldquo;You forget, Miss Livingstone, that we are not in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; rejoined the lady, &ldquo;if, as I believe, that <i>young</i>&rdquo; (and
      she laid an ill-natured emphasis on the word) &ldquo;gentleman has undertaken
      the duties of keeper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tutor,&rdquo; interposed the General sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tutor, then, if you like to call it so,&rdquo; continued Miss
      Livingstone, &ldquo;the name does not much signify. But if Mr. Arundel is to
      have the care of this dreadful boy, the sooner he knows what his duties
      will be, and sets about them, the better; for I tell you plainly, General
      Grant, that unless there&rsquo;s a man about the creature who can manage him, I
      won&rsquo;t sleep another night in the house with him. There&rsquo;s no trusting those
      idiots; we may all be murdered in our beds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the good lady, who had by this time got the steam up to a very high
      degree of pressure, hazarded the above uncomfortable suggestion, Annie,
      who had been listening with an expression of painful annoyance to her
      aunt&rsquo;s harangue, suddenly turned pale and glanced with a look of appealing
      inquiry towards her father, who replied to her rather than to Miss
      Livingstone in the following terms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear Annie, I am compelled to say that the fears with which
      your excellent relative&rdquo; (and he looked bayonets at Minerva, who shook her
      head till her terrific cap rustled like an angry hailstorm) &ldquo;would seek to
      inspire you are utterly without foundation.&rdquo; He paused, took a pinch of
      snuff viciously, as though it were gunpowder and he was priming himself
      for a fresh discharge; and thus prepared he turned to Lewis, saying&mdash;but
      we will reserve the volley for another chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;CONTAINS MUCH FOLLY AND A LITTLE COMMON SENSE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;T</span>he truth of the
      matter is this, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; began General Grant. &ldquo;From a mistaken policy
      your future pupil has been indulged in every caprice of his weak
      intellect, till the slightest opposition to his wishes irritates him
      beyond all control that has yet been exercised over him; but as his only
      attendants are an old female domestic who was his nurse, and her son, a
      lad younger than Sir Walter himself, whom he has been foolishly permitted
      to look upon in the light of a companion, this is not so much to be
      wondered at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a difficult task to eradicate faults of temper which have been
      allowed to become habitual, especially where the reasoning faculties are
      defective,&rdquo; observed Lewis thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well say that, sir,&rdquo; chimed in Miss Livingstone. &ldquo;His reasoning
      faculties (as you please to term them) are so <i>defective</i>, that in my
      humble opinion the boy is neither more nor less than a fool; and you may
      as well try to drive a pig straight as to talk sense to a fool. But how a
      man so particular as General Grant can have brought such an inmate into
      his family, and then expect that things are to go on with the order and
      precision that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; began the General in a voice of thunder, his stock of patience
      utterly exhausted by this indirect mode of attack. But Annie, with a
      degree of tact and moral courage for which Lewis had by no means been
      disposed to give her credit, laid her hand imploringly on her father&rsquo;s
      arm, and whispered a few magical words which served to avert the storm
      that had appeared inevitable. An awkward pause ensued, which was broken by
      the General, who, rising majestically from his chair, informed Lewis that
      he should request his attendance in half-an-hour; then casting a withering
      glance at Miss Livingstone, which caused that respectable porcupine of
      private life to bristle up if possible more fiercely than before, he
      quitted the room. No sooner had her nephew-in-law&rsquo;s retreating footsteps
      ceased to echo through the long corridor than the good lady, freed from
      the restraint of his presence, did then and there openly, avowedly, and
      with much vehemence, utter a declaration of war to the knife with that
      gallant officer, issued a protest against the introduction of &ldquo;rampant
      idiots&rdquo; into that heretofore peaceful family, and finally assert her own
      liberty of action by promulgating her determination to depart forthwith,
      leaving her companions to contemplate the agreeable contingencies of
      &ldquo;being frightened out of their wits every day, and murdered in their beds
      all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having in some degree relieved her mind by this explosion, she applied the
      superfluous steam still remaining to the purpose of locomotion, her crisp
      schako rending the air, and her high-heeled shoes knocking sharp little
      double knocks, as of an angry postman, against the polished oak floor as
      she swept along.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these &ldquo;pleasant passages&rdquo; were the first votive offering which Lewis
      saw presented to the Lares and Penates of Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant sat bolt upright in his easy-chair, as if he were on his
      charger, and his face wore an expression of scrutinising authority, as of
      a commander about to review his troops, when Lewis, in obedience to his
      summons, entered the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a chair, Mr. Arundel. I have desired the attendance of Sir Walter
      Desborough, and expect he will be here immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In compliance with this request, Lewis seated himself to await the arrival
      of his future pupil; but the minutes glided by, and still no pupil
      appeared. At length, just as the General&rsquo;s small stock of patience became
      exhausted and he had begged Lewis to ring the bell, the butler returned,
      saying that it was impossible to induce Sir Walter to leave his room
      unless his female attendant might come with him. General Grant frowned
      portentously, glanced expressively towards Lewis, muttering, &ldquo;Some of the
      evil effects of a grievous system of neglect,&rdquo; then added, to the servant,
      &ldquo;You may desire Mrs. Peters to accompany Sir Walter Desborough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the first points to which you will have to direct your attention,
      Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; continued the General as the domestic quitted the apartment,
      &ldquo;is to induce my ward to dispense with the society of this person and her
      son. He may retain their services as attendants, but must be taught no
      longer to regard them as companions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the door opened and admitted three individuals. Of these, the
      first who claims our notice was the unfortunate young baronet who was to
      be Lewis&rsquo;s future charge. He appeared about fourteen, but was tall for
      that age; his figure was slight and not ungraceful, and his features were
      handsome; his forehead was high, but narrow and receding; his eyes were
      bright and clear, though totally devoid of expression, and there was an
      appearance of weakness and irresolution about the mouth, which too clearly
      indicated his want of intellect. Mrs. Peters was a very stout old lady, on
      whom the cares of life and a rare specimen of the female costume of some
      bygone age appeared to sit easily; her outline might have suggested to an
      imaginative beholder the idea of a huge pillow which had &ldquo;come alive&rdquo; and
      made itself a gown out of one of the chintz bed-curtains, forgetting the
      waist. Her conversation was embellished by a redundancy of mild
      ejaculations, amongst which a benediction on her own &ldquo;heart alive,&rdquo; and an
      apostrophe to a solitary possessive pronoun which had lost its noun, and
      agreed with nothing in particular, stood pre-eminent. Her stock of ideas,
      which was by no means inconveniently large, had been presented to her in
      her youth, and required altering to suit the present fashion. Still she
      was a good old woman in her way; her &ldquo;heart alive&rdquo; was a very kind one;
      and she doated on poor Walter, spoiling and indulging him till she had
      made even a greater fool of him than nature had intended. The trio was
      completed by her hopeful son Robert, or, as he was more familiarly termed,
      Bob Peters, who, one year younger than Sir Walter, was as clever and
      mischievous an imp as ever indued a page&rsquo;s livery and bore a splendid crop
      of buttons to fascinate society. Pressing close to his nurse&rsquo;s side and
      dragging the pretty page after him by the wrist, Walter entered the
      alarming presence of his guardian and his tutor, hanging back like a
      startled colt the moment he perceived a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter, come here; I want to introduce you to this gentleman,&rdquo; exclaimed
      General Grant in the blandest tone he could command; but in vain&mdash;Walter
      only hung his head and shrank closer to his protectress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my! Walter dearie, go to the General. Bless my heart alive, you ain&rsquo;t
      so silly as to be afraid of <i>him</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Peters,
      emphasising the <i>him</i>. as though it referred to a pet lamb or a tame
      rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in and win, Master Walter; the gentleman won&rsquo;t bite yer,&rdquo; suggested
      Bob in an audible whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their remonstrances produced no effect upon Walter, and served only to
      increase General Grant&rsquo;s irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be taught obedience, sir,&rdquo; he remarked quickly, appealing to
      Lewis. &ldquo;Nothing can be done until he becomes obedient;&rdquo; then turning to
      the old nurse, he continued, &ldquo;Mrs. Peters, Sir Walter will not require
      your attendance at present; you may leave the room, and take your son with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeard, sir, you won&rsquo;t be able to do nothing with Master Walter
      without one of us stops with him. You see, he&rsquo;s kind of used to us,&rdquo; urged
      Mrs. Peters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall feel obliged by your leaving the room, Mrs. Peters. When I
      require your advice! will inform you of the fact,&rdquo; returned the General,
      walking with stately steps towards the door, which he held partially open
      to permit the egress of the servants, while he prevented Walter from
      following them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he saw his friends depart the boy raised his eyes, which gleamed with
      mingled fear and anger, to General Grant&rsquo;s face, but cold inflexibility
      was written there so unmistakably that even the darkened perceptions of
      the idiot could not fail to perceive it; and apparently feeling
      instinctively that resistance would be unavailing, his countenance assumed
      a sulky, dogged expression, and he suffered himself to be led to a seat
      without opposition. But, despite this success, the General seemed as far
      from gaining his point as ever; neither kindness nor coercion could induce
      Walter to pay the slightest attention to the remarks addressed to him, or
      to utter a single word. Any one, to have seen him at that moment, would
      have imagined him to be hopelessly imbecile. That such was not the case,
      however, Lewis, who without interfering openly had been closely observing
      him from the moment of his entrance, felt convinced. He had particularly
      watched the play of his features, and had remarked when he first came in
      that they were characterised by an expression of fear and shyness rather
      than of stupidity, and that it was not until his guardian had banished
      those whom he knew well, and in whom he had confidence, that they assumed
      the look of stolid sulkiness which they now wore. After making several
      unsuccessful attempts to elicit from his ward some proof of intelligence,
      General Grant at length quitted the room in search of his daughter,
      actuated thereunto by a vague consciousness that his own manner might
      possibly be deficient in conciliatory power, and that Annie, from the fact
      of her belonging to the softer sex, possessed a decided advantage over him
      in this particular. Availing himself of this opportunity, Lewis caught up
      a young kitten which was playing about the room, towards which he had
      observed Walter cast several furtive glances; and caressing the little
      animal as he held it in his arms, he approached his pupil, saying quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you like the kitten, Walter, she is so playful and pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy made no answer, but the sullen look in his face gradually gave
      place to a milder expression, and he glanced from Lewis to the kitten with
      an appearance of intelligence, for which any one who had seen him a minute
      before would not have given him credit. Lewis saw that he had touched the
      right string, and continued in the same kind and gentle manner&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make a great pet of the kitten. She will play with us and amuse
      us nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this Walter drew closer to him, and seeming, in his interest
      about the kitten, to forget his fear of the stranger, held out his hands
      for the little creature to be given to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be kind to her if I let you have her?&rdquo; continued Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter nodded in token of assent, and Lewis handed him the kitten, which
      he immediately began to fondle and play with, laughing with childish glee
      at its gambols. After amusing himself in this manner for several minutes
      he suddenly turned to Lewis and asked in a half-whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like ponies, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delighted at this proof of the success of his attempt to win his pupil&rsquo;s
      confidence, Lewis signified his intense affection for ponies in general,
      and inquired whether Walter possessed one. On receiving an affirmative nod
      he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you very fond of riding it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question seemed to perplex the boy, for he made no reply, and a
      half-puzzled, vacant expression banished the gleam of intelligence which
      had lighted up his features. Lewis repeated the inquiry in two or three
      different forms, but with no better success. A pause ensued, during which
      the young tutor pondered with himself the best means of calling forth and
      strengthening the faint germs of intellect which evidently existed in the
      clouded mind of the poor idiot, when Walter again looked up and exclaimed
      abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob says I&rsquo;m to ride the pony when somebody comes to take care of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am that somebody,&rdquo; returned Lewis, smiling good-naturedly. &ldquo;You
      shall ride the pony to-day if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to please him, for he nodded and laughed, and resumed his
      gambols with the kitten. Suddenly a new idea appeared to strike him, for
      his face became clouded, and drawing close to Lewis, he whispered,
      pointing to the door by which General Grant had left the apartment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him, or he won&rsquo;t let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you think so, Walter? That gentleman is your guardian, and
      means to be very kind to you,&rdquo; returned Lewis; but Walter shook his head
      and repeated&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him; he won&rsquo;t let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the General returned, accompanied by Annie, whose feelings
      of sympathy and pity were slightly tempered by the fears which Miss
      Livingstone had laboured industriously to instil into her mind. Lewis drew
      the General on one side and gave him an outline of all that had passed
      during his absence, adding, that although it was of course too soon for
      him to judge with any degree of accuracy to what extent they might
      proceed, it was evident his pupil possessed some reasoning powers which
      cultivation might develop. And he was going on to add that harshness
      appeared to him likely rather to increase than diminish the evil, when his
      attention was attracted by an exclamation of anger from Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment General Grant returned his ward had relapsed into his former
      state of sullen apathy, and all Annie&rsquo;s attempts to induce him to notice
      her only appeared to increase his obstinacy, till at length she began to
      stroke the kitten, which he still held in his arms. This, for some
      unexplained cause (probably because he fancied she might be about to
      injure his favourite, or to deprive him of it), irritated him beyond
      control, and forgetting his fear in his anger, he uttered the exclamation
      above alluded to, and struck at her fiercely with a riding-whip which he
      had brought in with him. Springing forward, however, before the blow could
      descend, Lewis caught his uplifted arm and held it in an iron grasp, while
      in a grave but stern voice he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter, I am surprised at you. Attempt to strike a lady! You must never
      do such a thing again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The calm, impressive manner in which he uttered these words appeared to
      produce a beneficial effect in subduing the boy&rsquo;s irritation; for after
      making one furious but unavailing attempt to free himself, he sat
      perfectly still and unresisting. Nothing, however, could induce him to
      make friends with Annie, or to allow her to touch his beloved kitten,
      though when Lewis caressed it, and even took it in his arms, he appeared
      well contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight&rsquo;s careful study of the young baronet&rsquo;s character only served
      to confirm the impressions Lewis had received during this first interview.
      That he possessed some powers of reasoning and reflection was evident; but
      the great difficulty lay in finding a key to the workings of his mind by
      aid of which these powers might be strengthened and developed. Any direct
      question seemed to puzzle and confuse him, and the only plan which
      appeared to offer any hope of success was, if possible, to discover some
      train of thought (if the vague and desultory fancies which flitted across
      his feeble brain deserved to be so called), and then to lead him gently on
      by suggesting new ideas, some of which he might adopt and retain. But it
      was an up-hill task; and often when Lewis, with a degree of calm
      perseverance which in one of his eager and impetuous disposition could
      scarcely have been looked for, had succeeded in making him acquire, as he
      believed, a leading idea on which he hoped to base some superstructure of
      elementary knowledge, a look of hopeless vacuity would show that no
      progress had been made, and that the labour must all be gone through
      again. At other times some shrewd remark or pertinent question would take
      Lewis as it were by surprise, and induce him to imagine that he had
      underrated his pupil&rsquo;s mental capacity, and that the fault must lie in his
      own inexperience of such cases. But there was much to be unlearned as well
      as to be taught. As is often the case in persons of weak intellect, the
      mere animal tendencies were unusually strong. He was subject to violent
      bursts of passion, if his will were in the slightest degree thwarted,
      which it required all Lewis&rsquo;s firmness and strength of character to
      contend against successfully. Occasionally fits of melancholy would seize
      him, during which he would sit for hours without speaking, his head
      resting dejectedly on his hand, and nothing appearing able to interest or
      amuse him. If not prevented, he would eat so voraciously as to injure his
      health. He was also indolent and averse to active exertion of any kind.
      But Lewis took much pains to teach him to ride, and the exercise thus
      obtained tended greatly to strengthen his constitution. His fondness for
      animals was one of the most amiable points in his disposition. He and
      Faust ere long became inseparable, and Lewis found the dog a most useful
      auxiliary in inculcating&mdash;by example, not precept, for Faust could
      not <i>quite</i> talk&mdash;the necessity of implicit obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month soon glided by, and at its expiration Lewis informed General Grant
      that if he still wished him to undertake the care of his ward he was
      willing to do so; an offer of which that noble commander joyfully availed
      himself, being in his secret soul equally surprised and pleased at the
      degree of success which had already attended Lewis&rsquo;s efforts, and only too
      glad to secure the services of one who could and would save him all
      further difficulty in regard to the onerous and troublesome responsibility
      which he had taken upon himself. For the next six months of his residence
      at Broadhurst Lewis saw but little of the family. During the greater part
      of that time the General was absent on a visit to some relations in
      Scotland, whither his daughter accompanied him. Miss Livingstone, having
      supplied herself with a resident victim in the person of Miss Susan
      Pinner, an unhappy little fourteen-year-old cousin once removed (the
      further the better from such a relative, we should imagine), spent her
      time very much to her own satisfaction in daily offering up the helpless
      sacrifice thus acquired at the altar of her evil temper, and in
      tyrannising over the poor of the neighbourhood with most excruciating
      benevolence. A sick family was a rare treat to this venerable scourge.
      Nauseous were the medicines she forced down the throats of the destitute,
      aggravating the directions with which she tortured the suffering, hateful
      the dietary on which she nourished all sick persons and young children!
      Truly an irritating poor man&rsquo;s plaster was that sphinx of modern society,
      Minerva Livingstone, and Odipus himself would never have guessed at
      one-half her modes of ingeniously tormenting indigent merit. Fortunately,
      working out the details of this ferocious philanthropy occupied so much of
      the good lady&rsquo;s time that Lewis enjoyed a happy immunity from her
      attentions, and was allowed to put in practice his theories for the
      improvement of his pupil without let or hindrance; and it was with a
      degree of pleasure, which was in itself sufficient reward for his trouble,
      that he perceived his plans likely to succeed beyond his most sanguine
      expectations. Affairs were in this position when&mdash;but such an
      interesting disclosure requires a fresh chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;LEWIS RECEIVES A MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION, AND IS RUN
      AWAY WITH BY TWO YOUTHFUL BEAUTIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he arrival of the
      post-bag was an interesting event to Lewis, as almost the only pleasure he
      allowed himself was a rapid interchange of letters with his sister; and to
      this correspondence was he indebted for an amount of warm sympathy,
      judicious advice, and affectionate interest in his pursuits which tended
      greatly to relieve the monotony and diminish the irksomeness of his
      situation; but with the exception of Rose and (occasionally) Frere, his
      correspondents were exceedingly limited in number, and their epistles few
      and far between. It was then a matter of no small surprise to him to
      receive a businesslike-looking letter in an unknown handwriting. To break
      the seal (which bore the impression of the letters J. and L. united in a
      flourishing cipher that at first sight looked like a bad attempt to
      delineate a true lover&rsquo;s knot) was the work of a moment. The contents were
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;My partner and myself, having some connection with Warlington,
      were cognisant of the death of your late lamented father, which sad event
      was reported to have been caused by the sudden discovery of some important
      information contained in a public journal. It is in our power to impart to
      you the nature of that information; but as we have every reason to believe
      its importance has not been overrated, we are only prepared to do so on
      the following terms:&mdash;viz., the present receipt of ten guineas, and a
      bond pledging yourself to pay to us the sum of £200 should the information
      prove as valuable as we conceive it to be. Awaiting the favour of a speedy
      answer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have the honour to remain, Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours obediently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jones &amp; Levi, Attorneys-at-Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Street, Old Bailey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a strange letter!&rdquo; soliloquised Lewis, after perusing it carefully
      for the second time. &ldquo;The writer is evidently acquainted with the
      circumstances of my poor father&rsquo;s death, but that proves nothing; the
      newspaper story rests on the evidence of the library-keeper at Warlington,
      and he probably told it to every one who came into his shop for the next
      week; and this tale may have been invented to suit the circumstances, with
      a view to extort money. One has heard of such rogueries; still, in that
      case, why insist on the £200 bond? That seems as if Messrs. Jones &amp;
      Levi themselves had faith in the value of their information; or it may
      only be done in order to give me that impression. I&rsquo;ll send the letter up
      to Richard Frere and ask him to ferret out these gents&mdash;I dare say
      they <i>are</i> thorough gents. Walter, I will not allow you to give Faust
      all your gloves to play with; that is the third pair he has bitten to
      pieces this week. Faust! drop it, sir! Do you hear me? That&rsquo;s right&mdash;good,
      obedient dog! Now for Master Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he took a pen and wrote, in a delicately-formed yet free and
      bold hand, the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Frere,&mdash;Certain individuals, signing themselves &lsquo;Jones
      &amp; Levi,&rsquo; have seen fit to favour me with the enclosed mysterious
      communication, which on the face of the thing looks very like an attempt
      to swindle. As there is, however, just a remote possibility that something
      may come of it (for their account of the circumstances preceding my poor
      father&rsquo;s death tallies exactly with the recital my sister gave me on my
      return), you will, I am sure, add one more to your many kindnesses by
      investigating this matter for me. You must bear in mind that £10 notes are
      by no means too plentiful with me, and that, under present circumstances,
      my bond for £200 would scarcely be worth as many pence. My poor charge
      progresses slowly; he has become much more docile and tractable, and is
      considerably improved in manners and general amiability, but his mental
      capacity is lamentably deficient; his reasoning powers and usual habits of
      thought are about on a par with those of an average child of six or seven
      years old; many intelligent children of that age are greatly his superiors
      in intellect: still, he makes visible progress, and that is recompense
      sufficient for any expenditure of time and trouble. He appears much
      attached to me, and (perhaps for that very reason&mdash;perhaps from the
      necessity to love something, which exists in the nature of every man
      worthy of the name) I have become so deeply interested in him, that duties
      which six months ago I should have reckoned irksome in the extreme, I now
      find a real pleasure in performing. I bore you with these details
      because... because you are so old a friend that I have acquired a
      prescriptive right to bore you when I like. As Walter and Faust (who
      clearly knows that I am writing to you, and sends you an affectionate wag
      of the tail) are becoming impatient at the length of my epistle, there
      being a walk in prospect dependent on my arriving at a satisfactory
      conclusion, the sooner I do so the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours ever, L. A.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis folded and sealed this missive a servant entered with a note on a
      silver waiter, saying, as he presented it, &ldquo;For you, sir. I am desired to
      wait while you read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was written in a stiff, formal hand, and ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Livingstone presents her compliments to Mr. Arundel, and requests
      the favour of an interview with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is in the wind now, I wonder?&rdquo; thought Lewis, but he only said,
      &ldquo;Tell Miss Livingstone I will do myself the pleasure of waiting on her
      immediately,&rdquo; and the servant retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minerva was enthroned in state in the small drawing-room, the large one
      being an awful apartment, dedicated to high and solemn social
      convocations, and by no means lightly to be entered. Care sat upon her
      wrinkled brow, and looked as uncomfortable there as in such a situation
      might reasonably have been expected. As Lewis entered, this remarkable
      woman rose and performed as near an approach to a curtsey as her
      elephantine conformation would permit; then, graciously motioning her
      visitor to a seat, she growled an inquiry after the well-being of his
      pupil, promulgated a decidedly scandalous account of the state of the
      weather, with a disheartening prophecy appended relative to meteorological
      miseries yet to come; and having thus broken her own ice, dived into the
      chilly recesses of her cold water system, and fished up from its stony
      depths the weighty grievance that oppressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that the same post which had conveyed the mysterious document
      from Messrs. Jones &amp; Levi had also brought a letter from General Grant
      containing the intelligence that he was about to return home forthwith,
      that the house was to be prepared for the reception of a large Christmas
      party, and that he wished Miss Livingstone to pay a round of visits
      preparatory to the issue of innumerable notes of invitation, by which the
      neighbourhood was to be induced to attend sundry festive meetings at
      Broadhurst; and all this was to be done more thoroughly and on a larger
      scale than usual, for some mysterious reason in regard to which the
      General was equally urgent and enigmatical. But Minerva shall speak for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having thus, Mr. Arundel, made myself acquainted with General Grant&rsquo;s
      wishes (fourteen beds to be ready this day week, and not even the hangings
      put up on one of them&mdash;but men are so inconsiderate nowadays), I
      proceeded to give Reynolds (the housekeeper) full and clear instructions
      (to not one of which did she pay proper attention&mdash;but servants are
      so careless and self-conceited nowadays) as to all the necessary domestic
      arrangements. I then desired the coachman might be informed that I should
      require the carriage to be ready for use at two o&rsquo;clock to-morrow (as you
      are perhaps aware, sir, that since the General&rsquo;s departure for Scotland I
      have restricted myself to a simple pony-chaise). Judge of my amazement
      when I was told there were no horses fit for use! I begged to see the
      coachman instantly, but learned that he was confined to his bed with
      influenza. The second coachman is in Scotland with the General, so that in
      fact there was not a creature of sufficient respectability for me to
      converse with to whom I could give directions about the matter. Under
      these circumstances, which are equally unexpected and annoying, I
      considered myself justified in applying to you, Mr. Arundel. Would you
      oblige me by going through the stables and ascertaining whether anything
      can be devised to meet the present emergency? I am aware that the service
      I require of you is beyond the strict routine of your duties; but you must
      yourself perceive the impossibility of a lady venturing among stablemen
      and helpers without showing a disregard to that strict rule of propriety
      by which it has been the study of my life to regulate my conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having reached this climax, Minerva glanced with an air of dignified
      self-approval towards Lewis and began a very unnecessary process of
      refrigeration with the aid of a fan apparently composed, like its
      mistress, of equal parts of cast-iron and buckram. Lewis immediately
      signified his readiness to undertake the commission, and promising to
      return and report progress, bowed and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the stables a groom attended his summons, and, after the
      fashion of his race, entered into a long explanation of the series of
      untoward circumstances to which the present state of equine destitution
      might be attributed, in the course of which harangue he performed, so to
      speak, a fantasia on the theme, &ldquo;And then do you see, sir, coachman being
      hill,&rdquo; to which sentence, after each variation, he constantly returned.
      The substance of his communication was as follows:&mdash;Shortly before
      the General&rsquo;s departure one of the carriage horses had fallen and broken
      his knees, and its companion having an unamiable predilection for kicking,
      the pair were sold and a couple of young unbroken animals purchased,
      which, after a summer&rsquo;s run, were destined to replace the delinquents.
      Shortly after this the General fell in love with and bought a pair of
      iron-grey four-year-olds, also untrained. All these young horses were now
      taken up from grass and about to be broken in, but the coachman&rsquo;s illness
      had interrupted their education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but are neither pair of the young stock available?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeared not, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The bays ain&rsquo;t never been in
      harness, and the iron-greys only three times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the greys <i>have</i> been in harness three times, have they?&rdquo;
       resumed Lewis. &ldquo;Let us take them out to-day and see how they perform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, I am only pad groom, and I can&rsquo;t say as I should feel
      myself disactly compertent to drive them wild young devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring out that mail phaeton; put on the break harness, and I&rsquo;ll drive
      them myself,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if you please, sir,&rdquo; began the groom in a tone of remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow, you waste time in talking. Of course if anything goes
      wrong in consequence of your obeying my directions, I alone shall be
      answerable; but nothing will go wrong if your harness is sound,&rdquo; returned
      Lewis quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, seeing the young tutor was determined, summoned one of his
      fellows, and in a short time the phaeton was made ready and the horses
      harnessed and led out. They were a splendid pair of dark iron-greys, with
      silver manes and tails; their heads, small and well set on, their sloping
      shoulders, and fine graceful legs, spoke well for their descent; but they
      snorted with fear and impatience as they were led up to their places, and
      their bright full eyes gazed wildly and restlessly around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet with them!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis as one of the men laid a rude grasp
      on the rein to back the near-side horse into his place. &ldquo;You never can be
      too quiet and steady with a young horse. Soho, boy! what is it then?
      nobody is going to hurt you,&rdquo; he continued, patting the startled animal,
      and at the same time backing him gently into the required position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation of putting-to was soon completed; and Lewis saying, &ldquo;You had
      better lead them off if there is any difficulty in getting them to start,&rdquo;
       took the reins in his hands and sprang up lightly but quietly. Seating
      himself firmly, he asked, &ldquo;Now, are you all ready?&rdquo; and receiving an
      answer in the affirmative, continued, &ldquo;Give them their heads;&rdquo; then making
      a mysterious sound which may be faintly portrayed by the letters &ldquo;tchick,&rdquo;
       he endeavoured to start his horses. But this was no such easy matter. The
      near-side horse the moment he felt the collar ran back, pulling against
      his companion, who returned the compliment by rearing and striking with
      his fore-feet at the groom who attempted to hold him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady there!&rdquo; cried Lewis. &ldquo;Pat his neck; that&rsquo;s right. Quiet, horse!
      stand, sir! One of you call those men here,&rdquo; he added, pointing to a
      couple of labourers who were digging in a slip of ground near. &ldquo;Now, my
      men,&rdquo; he resumed as they came up, &ldquo;take hold of the spokes of the hind
      wheels and move the carriage on when I give you the signal. Are you ready?
      Stand clear; all right.&rdquo; As he spoke he again attempted to start the
      horses, and this time more successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal which had reared at the first attempt sprang forward, and
      finding the weight which he had probably fancied was immovable yield to
      his efforts, appeared anxious to proceed, but the other still hung back,
      and was partly dragged forward by his yoke-fellow, partly pushed on by the
      men who were propelling the carriage. Lewis again tried mild measures, but
      without effect; and at length, considering that the soothing system had
      been carried far enough, he drew the point of the whip smartly across the
      animal&rsquo;s shoulder. In reply to this the recusant flung up his heels as
      high as the kicking-straps would permit; but on a second and rather
      sharper application of the thong he plunged forward and threw himself into
      the collar with a bound that tried the strength of the traces; then
      pulling like a steam-engine, appeared resolved to revenge himself on his
      driver by straining every sinew of his arms to the utmost pitch of
      tension. But rowing, fencing, and other athletic exercises had rendered
      those arms as hard as iron; and though the swollen muscles rounded and
      stood out till his coat-sleeve was stretched almost to bursting, Lewis
      continued to hold the reins in a vice-like grasp, and the fiery horses,
      arching their proud necks and tossing the foam-flakes from their champing
      jaws, were compelled to proceed at a moderate pace. The grooms ran by
      their sides for a short distance, then, at a sign from Lewis, one of the
      men watched his opportunity and scrambled up while the phaeton was still
      going on; the other, having opened a gate leading down a road through the
      park, remained gazing after them with looks of the deepest interest.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, you&rsquo;ve managed to start &rsquo;em easier than I expected,&rdquo;
       observed the groom, as, in compliance with Lewis&rsquo;s desire, he seated
      himself at his side. &ldquo;Coachman was a good half-hour a getting &rsquo;em
      hout of the yard last time as they was put-to; that near-sider wouldn&rsquo;t
      take the collar no how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet he&rsquo;ll turn out the better horse of the two if he&rsquo;s judiciously
      managed,&rdquo; returned Lewis. &ldquo;He has higher courage than his companion,
      though they&rsquo;re both splendid animals. They only require careful driving
      and working moderately every day to make as good a pair of carriage-horses
      as a man need wish to sit behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the first time as you&rsquo;ve handled the ribbons by a good many, I
      should say, sir,&rdquo; continued Bob Richards (for that was the man&rsquo;s name,
      dear reader, although I&rsquo;ve never had an opportunity of telling you so
      before). &ldquo;I see&rsquo;d as you know&rsquo;d what you was about afore ever you got on
      the box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Before</i> I got up!&rdquo; returned Lewis. &ldquo;How did you manage that, my
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, the furst thing as you did was to cast your eye over the
      harness to see as all was right; then, afore ever you put your foot on the
      step you took the reins into your hands, so that the minute you was up you
      was ready for a bolt, hif so be it had pleased Providence to start the &rsquo;orses
      off suddenly. Now, anybody as wasn&rsquo;t used to the ways of four-footed
      quadrupals wouldn&rsquo;t never have thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your powers of observation do you credit,&rdquo; returned Lewis, with
      difficulty repressing a smile. &ldquo;You are right, I have been accustomed to
      driving, as you imagine.&rdquo; And as he spoke the remembrance of scenes and
      persons now far away came across him, and he thought with regret of
      pleasant hours passed with his young associates in Germany, when the mere
      fact of his being an Englishman caused him to be regarded as an oracle on
      all matters connected with horseflesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation was taking place the iron-greys had proceeded
      about a mile through the park, dancing, curvetting, and staring on all
      sides, as though they would fain shy at every object they discerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are gradually dropping into a steadier pace, you see,&rdquo; observed
      Lewis; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be tired of jumping about, and glad to trot without
      breaking into a canter, when they get a little warm to their work. Quiet,
      boy, quiet!&rdquo; he continued, as the horses suddenly pricked up their ears
      and stared wildly about them; &ldquo;gently there, gently! What in the world are
      they frightened at now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question did not long remain a doubtful one, for in another minute a
      hollow, rushing sound became audible, and a herd of deer, startled by the
      rattling of the carriage, broke from a thicket hard by, and bounding over
      the tall fern and stunted brushwood, darted across the road, their long
      thin legs and branching antlers, indistinctly seen in the grey light of an
      autumn day, giving them a strange and spectre-like appearance. But Lewis
      had no time to trace fanciful resemblances, for the horses demanded all
      his attention. As the sound of pattering feet approached they began to
      plunge violently; at the sight of the deer they stopped short, snorting
      and trembling with fright; and when the herd crossed the road before them,
      perfectly maddened with terror they reared till they almost stood upright;
      then, turning short round, they dashed off the road at right angles,
      nearly overturning the phaeton as they did so, and breaking into a mad
      gallop, despite all their driver&rsquo;s efforts to restrain them, tore away
      with the speed of lightning. For a few seconds the sound of the wind
      whistling past his ears, and oppressing his breathing to a painful degree,
      confused Lewis and deprived him of the power of speech; but the imminence
      of the danger, and the necessity for calmness and decision, served to
      restore his self-possession, and turning towards his companion, who, pale
      with terror, sat convulsively grasping the rail of the seat, he inquired&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you recollect whether there are any ditches across the park in this
      direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no ditches, as I recollects,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s
      something a precious sight worser. If these devils go straight ahead for
      five minutes longer at this pace, we shall be dashed over the bank of the
      lake into ten foot water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember; I see where we are now. The ground rises to the left,
      and is clear of trees and ditches, is it not?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom replied in the affirmative, and Lewis continued: &ldquo;Then we must
      endeavour to turn them; do you take the whip, stand up, and be ready to
      assist me at the right moment. What are you thinking of?&rdquo; he continued,
      seeing that the man hesitated and was apparently measuring with his eye
      the distance from the step to the ground. &ldquo;It would be madness to jump out
      while we are going at this rate. Be cool, and we shall do very well yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreeable to do whatever you tells me, only be quick about it, sir,&rdquo;
       rejoined the groom. &ldquo;For if it comes to jumping hout, or sitting still to
      be drownded, hout I goes, that&rsquo;s flat, for I never could abear cold
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the reins are strong, and to be depended on?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly new, sir,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be ready; and when I tell you, exert yourself,&rdquo; continued Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these remarks passed between the two occupants of the phaeton, the
      horses still continued their mad career, resisting successfully all
      attempts to check the frightful speed at which they were hurrying on
      towards certain destruction. As they dashed past a clump of shrubs, which
      had hitherto concealed from view the danger to which they were exposed,
      the full peril of their situation became evident to the eyes of Lewis and
      his companion. With steep and broken banks, on which American shrubs,
      mixed with flags and bulrushes, grew in unbounded luxuriance, the lake lay
      stretched before them, its clear depths reflecting the leaden hue of the
      wintry sky, and a slight breeze from the north rippling its polished
      surface. Less than a quarter of a mile of smooth greensward separated them
      from their dangerous neighbour. An artist would have longed to seize this
      moment for transferring to canvas or marble the expression of Lewis&rsquo;s
      features. As he perceived the nearness and reality of the danger that
      threatened him, his spirit rose with the occasion, and calm self-reliance,
      dauntless courage, and an energetic determination to subdue the infuriated
      animals before him, at whatever risk, lent a brilliancy to his flashing
      eye, and imparted a look of stern resolve to his finely cut mouth, which
      invested his unusual beauty with a character of superhuman power such as
      the sculptors of antiquity sought to immortalise in their statues of
      heroes and demigods. Selecting an open space of turf unencumbered with
      trees or other obstacles, Lewis once more addressed his companion, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now be ready. I am going to endeavour to turn them to the left, in order
      to get their heads away from the lake and uphill; but as I shall require
      both hands and all my strength for the reins, I want you to stand up and
      touch them smartly with the whip on the off-side of the neck. If you do
      this at the right moment, it will help to bring them round. Do you
      understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richards replied in the affirmative, and Lewis, leaning forward and
      shortening his grasp on the reins, worked the mouths of the horses till he
      got their heads well up; then assuring himself by a glance that his
      companion was ready, he checked their speed by a great exertion of
      strength; and tightening the left rein suddenly, the groom at the same
      moment applying the whip as he had been desired, the fiery steeds,
      springing from the lash and yielding to the pressure of the bit, altered
      their course, and going round so sharply that the phaeton was again within
      an ace of being overturned, dashed forward in an opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did that uncommon well, to be sure, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Richards, drawing
      a long breath like one relieved from the pressure of a painful weight. &ldquo;I
      thought we was over once, though; it was a precious near go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A miss is as good as a mile,&rdquo; returned Lewis, smiling. &ldquo;Do you see,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;they are slackening their pace; the hill is beginning to tell
      upon them already. Hand me the whip; I shall give the gentlemen a bit of a
      lesson before I allow them to stop, just to convince them that running
      away is not such a pleasant amusement as they appear to imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he waited till the horses began sensibly to relax their speed;
      then holding them tightly in hand, he punished them with the whip pretty
      severely, and gave them a good deal more running than they liked before he
      permitted them to stop, the nature of the ground (a gentle ascent of
      perfectly smooth turf) allowing him to inflict this discipline with
      impunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After proceeding two or three miles at the same speed he perceived another
      cross-road running through the park. Gradually pulling up as he approached
      it, he got his horses into a walk, and as soon as they had once again
      exchanged grass for gravel he stopped them to recover wind. The groom got
      down, and gathering a handful of fern, wiped the foam from their mouths
      and the perspiration from their reeking flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given &rsquo;em a pretty tidy warming, though, sir,&rdquo; he observed.
      &ldquo;If I was you I would not keep &rsquo;em standing too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are we from the house, do you imagine?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three mile, I should say,&rdquo; returned Richards. &ldquo;It will take you
      nigh upon half-an-hour, if you drives &rsquo;em easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis looked at his watch, muttering, &ldquo;More than an hour to Walter&rsquo;s
      dinner-time.&rdquo; He then continued, &ldquo;Get up, Richards; I have not quite done
      with these horses yet;&rdquo; adding, in reply to the man&rsquo;s questioning glance
      as he reseated himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going to teach them that a herd of deer
      is not such a frightful object as they seem to imagine it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure<i>ly</i> you&rsquo;re never agoin&rsquo; to take&rsquo;em near the deer again, Mr.
      Arundel; they&rsquo;ll never stand it, sir,&rdquo; expostulated Richards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can get down if you like,&rdquo; observed Lewis, with the slightest
      possible shade of contempt in his tone. &ldquo;I will pick you up here as I
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richards was a thorough John Bull, and it is a well-known fact that to
      hint to one of that enlightened race that he is afraid to do the most
      insane deed imaginable is quite sufficient to determine him to go through
      with it at all hazards. Accordingly, the individual in question pressed
      his hat on his brows to be prepared for the worst, and folding his arms
      with an air of injured dignity, sat sullenly hoping for an overturn, which
      might prove him right, even at the risk of a broken neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s quick eye had discerned the herd of deer against a dark background
      of trees which had served to screen them from the less acute perceptions
      of the servant, and he now contrived, by skirting the aforesaid belt of
      Scotch firs, to bring the phaeton near the place where the deer were
      stationed without disturbing them, so that the horses were able clearly to
      see the creatures which had before so greatly alarmed them. It has been
      often remarked that horses are greatly terrified by an object seen but
      indistinctly, at which, when they are able to observe it more closely,
      they will show no signs of fear. Whether for this reason, or that the
      discipline they had undergone had cooled their courage and taught them the
      necessity of obedience, the iron-greys approached the herd of deer without
      attempting to repeat the manoeuvre which had been so nearly proving fatal
      to their driver and his companion. Lewis drove them up and down once or
      twice, each time decreasing the distance between the horses and the
      animals, to the sight of which he wished to accustom them, without any
      attempt at rebellion on their part beyond a slight preference for using
      their hind legs only in progression, and a very becoming determination to
      arch their necks and point their ears after the fashion of those
      high-spirited impossibilities which do duty for horses in Greek friezes
      and in the heated imagination of young lady artists, who possess a
      wonderful (a very wonderful) talent for sketching animals. Having
      continued this amusement till the deer once again conveyed themselves
      away, Lewis, delighted at having carried his point and overcome the
      difficulties which had opposed him, drove gently back to Broadhurst; and
      having committed the reeking horses to the care of a couple of grooms, who
      began hissing at them like a whole brood of serpents, returned to make his
      report and soothe the tribulation of that anxious hyæna in petticoats,
      Miss Martha Livingstone.

      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;CHARLEY LEICESTER BEWAILS HIS CRUEL MISFORTUNE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rere&rsquo;s answer to
      Lewis&rsquo;s note made its appearance at Broadhurst on the morning of the
      second day after that on which the events narrated in the previous chapter
      took place. It ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lewis,&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ve told you before&mdash;(if it wasn&rsquo;t you it
      was your sister, which is much the same thing)&mdash;not to write such a
      pack of nonsense as &lsquo;adding to my many kindnesses,&rsquo; and all that sort of
      stuff, because it&rsquo;s just so much time and trouble wasted. I see no
      particular kindness in it, that&rsquo;s the fact. You and she live in the
      country, and I in town; and if there is anything that either of you want
      here, why of course it&rsquo;s natural to tell me to get or to do it for you;
      and as to apologising, or making pretty speeches every time you require
      anything, it&rsquo;s sheer folly; besides, I <i>like</i> doing the things for
      you. If I didn&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t do them, you may depend upon <i>that</i>; so
      no more of such rubbish &lsquo;an you love me.&rsquo; And now, touching those
      interesting, or rather interest<i>ed</i>, individuals, Messrs. Jones &amp;
      Levi. I thought when I read their letter they were rascals or thereabouts,
      but a personal interview placed the matter beyond doubt; and if you take
      my advice, you&rsquo;ll see them&mdash;well, never mind where&mdash;but keep
      your £10 in your pocket, that&rsquo;s all. Depend upon it, they are more used to
      making rich men poor than poor ones rich. However, I&rsquo;ll tell you all their
      sayings and doings, as far as I am acquainted therewith, and then you can
      judge for yourself. As soon as I received your letter I trudged off into
      the city, found the den of thieves&mdash;I mean the lawyer&rsquo;s office&mdash;of
      which I was in search, sent in my card by an unwashed Israelite with a pen
      behind each ear and ink all over him, whom I took to be a clerk, and by
      the same unsavoury individual was ushered into the presence of Messrs.
      Jones &amp; Levi. Jones was a long cadaverous-looking animal, with a
      clever, bad face, and the eye of a hawk; Levi, a fat Jew, and apparently a
      German into the bargain, with a cunning expression of countenance and a
      cringing manner, who gave one the idea of having been fed on oil-cake till
      he had become something of the sort himself; a kind of man who, if you had
      put a wick into him, wouldn&rsquo;t have made a bad candle, only one should so
      have longed to snuff him out. Well, I soon told these worthies what I was
      come about, and then waited to hear all they had to say for themselves.
      The Gentile, being most richly gifted with speech, took upon him to reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let me offer you a chair, Mr. Frere, sir. Delighted to have the honour
      of making your acquaintance. I speak for my partner and myself&mdash;eh,
      Mr. Levi?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In courshe, shir. Moosh playsure, Misthur Vreer, shir,&rsquo; muttered Levi,
      who spoke through his nose, after the manner of modern Israelites, as if
      that organ were afflicted with a permanent cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I had seated myself Jones returned to the attack by observing: &lsquo;Our
      letter contained a certain definite and specific offer. Does Mr. Arundel
      agree to that, Mr. Frere, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Arundel has placed the matter entirely in my hands, Mr. Jones,&rsquo;
      replied I; &lsquo;and before I can agree to anything I must understand clearly
      what benefit my friend is likely to derive from the information hinted at
      in your letter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;May I inquire, Mr. Frere, sir, whether you are a professional man?&rsquo;
      asked Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you mean a lawyer, Mr. Jones,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;I am thankful to say I am
      not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he did not exactly relish my remark, for he resumed, in a less
      amicable tone than he had used before&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I believe the letter to which I have already referred contained a clear
      statement of the <i>only</i>&rsquo; (he emphasised the word strongly) &lsquo;terms
      upon which we should be disposed to communicate the information,&rsquo; and he
      glanced towards his partner, who echoed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;De <i>only</i> turmsh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then, gentlemen,&rsquo; said I (gentlemen, indeed!), &lsquo;I beg most distinctly to
      inform you that my friend shall never, with my consent, pay £10 down and
      become liable for £200 more, this liability depending on a contingency
      which you have no doubt provided against, on the mere chance that some
      information in your possession may refer to the exciting cause of his
      father&rsquo;s death and prove valuable to him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;De informationsh ish mosht faluaple,&rsquo; broke in Levi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I beg pardon, Mr. Levi,&rsquo; exclaimed Jones quickly, &lsquo;but I believe we
      agreed this matter was to be left to my management?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Levi nodded his large head and looked contrite, while Jones continued:
      &lsquo;In that case, Mr. Frere, sir, I have only to add that if Mr. Arundel
      refuses to comply with our terms we shall not part with the information on
      any others. At the same time, I should advise him to reconsider the
      matter, for I do not hesitate to say that I quite coincide with Mr. Levi
      in his opinion concerning the importance of the information which is in
      our possession.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he said this an idea occurred to me, and I replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Suppose, instead of the bond for £200 in the event of some contingency
      which may never occur, Mr. Arundel were willing to pay £20 down for the
      information, would you agree to that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Say vive and dirtysh,&rsquo; put in the Jew, his dull eyes brightening at the
      prospect of money. &lsquo;Say vive and dirtysh, and it shall pe von pargainsh.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Would you agree to take that sum, Mr. Jones?&rsquo; asked I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He glanced at his partner with a slight contraction of the brow and shook
      his head; but the spirit of avarice aroused in the Jew was not so easily
      to be put down, and he continued, in a more positive tone than he had yet
      ventured to use&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yesh, he dosh agree. Me and my bardner ve vill take the vive and dirtysh
      poundsh, ready monish, Mr. Vreer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not quite so fast, my good sir,&rsquo; returned I. &lsquo;If you are so very ready
      to give up the bond for £200, to be paid in case the information should
      prove as valuable as you assert it to be, the natural inference is that
      you yourself have mighty little faith in the truth of your assertion; and
      as I happen to be pretty much of that way of thinking also, I shall wish
      you both good morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So saying, I put on my hat and walked out of the room, leaving the Jew
      and the Gentile to fight it out to their own satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not a very strong affection for lawyers before, and I can&rsquo;t say
      this visit has served to endear the profession to me particularly. You
      know the old story of the man who defined the difference between an
      attorney and a solicitor to be much the same as that between an alligator
      and a crocodile. Well, Messrs. Jones &amp; Levi realised such a definition
      to the life, for a more detestable brace of rascals I never encountered;
      and depend upon it, the less you have to do with them the better; at
      least, such is the opinion of yours for ever and a day (always supposing
      such an epoch of time may exist),
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Frere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, refolding the letter, &ldquo;that chance has failed me.
      Well, I never expected anything would come of it; and yet&mdash;heigho! I
      certainly was born under an unlucky star. I think Frere was rather
      precipitate. According to his account of his proceedings, he seems to have
      felt such an intense conviction that the men were rascals that he called
      on them rather for the purpose of exposing them than to investigate the
      matter. He prejudged the question. However, I have no doubt the result
      would have been the same in any case. What a bore it is that men will be
      rogues! I shall have out those horses again after Walter has got through
      his lesson. If they go quietly I shall take him with me for a drive
      to-morrow.&rdquo; And thus communing with himself, he summoned Walter and
      commenced the usual morning routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Livingstone had, by Lewis&rsquo;s advice, ordered post-horses to the
      carriage, and was in that way enabled to accomplish her round of visits.
      Lewis carried out his intention of driving the iron-greys, who conducted
      themselves with so much propriety that on the following day he took his
      pupil with him, and finding the drive pleased and amused the poor boy he
      repeated it every fine day. Thus a week slipped away, and the time for the
      General&rsquo;s return arrived. It was late on the afternoon of the day on which
      he was expected, and Lewis was wearily assisting poor Walter to spell
      through a page of dissyllables, when that peculiar gravel-grinding sound
      became audible which, in a country house, necessarily precedes an arrival.
      Then there was a great bustle as of excited servants, a Babel-like
      confusion of tongues, bumps and thumps of heavy luggage, much trampling of
      feet, ringing of bells and slamming of doors; then the sounds grew
      fainter, were remitted at intervals, and at last ceased altogether. The
      house was no longer masterless&mdash;General Grant had returned. Walter&rsquo;s
      attention, by no means easy to command for five minutes together at the
      best of times, became so entirely estranged by the commotion above alluded
      to, that Lewis closed the book in despair and told him to go and play with
      Faust, who, sitting upright on a rug in front of the fire, was listening
      with the deepest interest to all that passed in the hall, and was only
      restrained from barking by a strict sense of propriety operating on a
      well-disciplined mind. The boy gladly obeyed, and Lewis, resting his
      aching head on his hand, fell into deep thought&mdash;he thought of old
      times, when, head of his class at a public school, alike leader and idol
      of the little world in which he moved, his young ambition had shaped out
      for itself a career in which the bar, the bench, the senate, were to be
      but stepping-stones to the highest honours to which energy and talent
      might attain; and he contrasted his present position with the ideal future
      his boyish fancy had depicted. Then he bethought him of the tyrant who
      commanded that a living man should be chained to a corpse, and considered
      how the cold and numbing influence of the dead, gradually paralysing the
      vital energy of the living, was, as it were, typical of his own fate. He
      could not but be conscious of unusual powers of mind, for he had tested
      them in the struggle for honours with the deep and subtile thinkers of
      Germany, and had come off victorious; and to reflect that these talents,
      which might have ensured him success in the game of life, were condemned
      to be wasted in the wearying attempt to call forth the faint germs of
      reason in the mind of an almost childish idiot! The thought was a bitter
      one! and yet for months past he had felt resigned to his fate; and the
      deep interest he took in his pupil&rsquo;s improvement, together with the time
      such a quiet life afforded for reflection and self-knowledge, had rendered
      him contented, if not what is conventionally termed happy. To what then
      should he attribute his present frame of mind? At this moment a tap at the
      study door interrupted his meditations, and he was unable to pursue his
      self-analysis further. Had he done so, he might possibly have discovered
      that pride, his besetting sin, lay at the root of the evil. As long as he
      lived in comparative seclusion his duties sat easily upon him; but now
      that he was again about to mix in society, his position as tutor became
      galling in the extreme to his haughty nature. As he heard the summons
      above mentioned he started from his reverie, and sweeping his hair from
      his forehead by a motion of his hand, exclaimed, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; As he spoke
      the door opened, and our old acquaintance, Charley Leicester, lounged into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how do you do, Arundel?&rdquo; he began in his usual languid tone. &ldquo;I know
      all the ins and outs of this place, and I thought I should find you here&mdash;this
      used to be <i>my</i> den once upon a time; many a holiday&rsquo;s task have I
      groaned over in this venerable apartment. Is that your incubus?&rdquo; he
      continued in a lower tone, glancing towards Walter. &ldquo;Handsome features,
      poor fellow! Does he understand what one says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely, unless you speak to him individually,&rdquo; returned Lewis. &ldquo;You may
      talk as you please before him, the chances are he will not attend; but if
      he does, he will only understand a bit here and there, and even that he
      will forget the next moment, when some trifle occurs to put it out of his
      head. Walter, come and shake hands with this gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoken to, Walter turned sheepishly away, and stooping down, hid his
      face behind Faust. Lewis&rsquo;s mouth grew stern. &ldquo;Faust, come here, sir!&rdquo; The
      dog arose, looked wistfully at his playfellow, licked his hand lovingly,
      then walking across the room, crouched down at his master&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Walter, look at me.&rdquo; At this second appeal the boy raised his eyes
      to Lewis&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Go and shake hands with Mr. Leicester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry him on my account, pray, my dear Arundel,&rdquo; interposed
      Leicester good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The General makes a great point of his being introduced to every one; and
      I make a great point of his doing as I bid him,&rdquo; returned Lewis with
      marked emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was unnecessary, if meant as a hint to Walter, for his tutor&rsquo;s eye
      appeared to possess a power of fascination over him. No sooner did he meet
      his glance than he arose from his kneeling position, and going up to
      Leicester held out his hand saying, &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley shook hands with him kindly, asked him one or two simple
      questions, to which he replied with tolerable readiness; then observing
      that his eyes were fixed on a silver-mounted cane he held in his hand, he
      inquired whether he thought it pretty, and receiving an answer in the
      affirmative, added, &ldquo;Then you may take it to amuse yourself with, if you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile of childish delight proved that the offer was an acceptable one;
      and carrying off his treasure with him and calling Faust, who on a sign
      from his master gladly obeyed the summons, he betook himself to the
      farther end of the room, which was a very large one, and began playing
      with his canine associate. Leicester gazed at him for a moment or two, and
      then observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a sad pity! Such a fine-grown, handsome lad, too! Why, in a year or
      two he will be a man in appearance, with the mind of a child. Does he
      improve much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he improves steadily, but very slowly,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester wandered dreamily up to a chimney-glass, arranged his hair with
      an air of deep abstraction, pulled up his shirt-collars, caressed his
      whiskers, then separating the tails of a nondescript garment, which gave
      one the idea of a cut-away coat trying to look like a shooting-jacket, he
      extended his legs so as to form two sides of a triangle, and subjecting
      his frigid zone to the genial influence of the fire, he enjoyed for some
      minutes in silence the mysterious delight afforded to all true-born
      Englishmen by the peculiar position above indicated. At length he sighed
      deeply and muttered, &ldquo;Heigho! it&rsquo;s no use thinking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on what it is, and how you set to work to think,&rdquo; returned
      Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may do as a general rule,&rdquo; continued Leicester, &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t apply
      to the case in point. The thing I was trying to cipher out, as the Yankees
      call it, is the incomprehensible distribution of property in this
      sublunary life. Now look at that poor boy&mdash;a stick for a plaything
      and a dog for a companion make him perfectly happy. Those are his only
      superfluous requirements, which together with eating, drinking, clothing,
      and lodging might be provided for £300 a year. Instead of that, when he is
      twenty-one he will come into from £8000 to £10,000 per annum, besides no
      end of savings during his minority. Well, to say nothing of your own case&rdquo;
       (Lewis&rsquo;s cheek kindled and his eye flashed, but Leicester, absorbed in his
      own thoughts, never noticed it, and continued), &ldquo;though with your talents
      a little loose cash to give you a fair start might be the making of you&mdash;-just
      look at my wretched position,&mdash;the son of a peer, brought up in all
      kinds of expensive habits, mixing in the best set at Eton and at Oxford,
      the chosen associate of men of large property, introduced into the highest
      society in London&mdash;of course I must do as others do, I can&rsquo;t help
      myself. There are certain things necessary to a young man about town just
      as indispensable as smock-frocks and bacon are to a ploughman. For
      instance, to live one must dine&mdash;to dine one must belong to a club.
      Then London is a good large place, even if one ignores everything east of
      Temple Bar; one must keep a cab if but to save boot-leather&mdash;that
      entails a horse and a tiger. Again, for four months in the year people
      talk about nothing but the opera&mdash;one can&rsquo;t hold one&rsquo;s tongue for
      four months, you know&mdash;that renders a stall indispensable. It&rsquo;s the
      fashion to wear white kid gloves, and the whole of London comes off black
      on everything, so there&rsquo;s a fine of 3s. 6d. a night only for having hands
      at the end of one&rsquo;s arms. The atmosphere of the metropolis is composed
      chiefly of smoke&mdash;the only kind of smoke one can inhale without being
      choked is tobacco smoke; besides, life without cigars would be a desert
      without an oasis&mdash;but unfortunately Havannahs don&rsquo;t hang on every
      hedge. I might multiply instances <i>ad infinitum</i>, but the thing is
      self-evident&mdash;to provide all these necessaries a man must possess
      money or credit, and I unfortunately have more of the latter than the
      former article. It is, as I have explained to you, utterly impossible for
      me to exist on less than&mdash;say £1500 a year; and even with my share of
      my poor mother&rsquo;s fortune and the Governor&rsquo;s allowance, my net income
      doesn&rsquo;t amount to £800; <i>ergo</i>, half the London and all the Oxford
      tradesmen possess little manuscript volumes containing interesting
      reminiscences of my private life. It&rsquo;s no laughing matter, I can assure
      you,&rdquo; he continued, seeing Lewis smile; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing cramps a man&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he released a coat-tail in order to raise his hand to conceal a yawn&mdash;&ldquo;augh!
      what do you call &rsquo;em?&mdash;energies&mdash;so much as having a load
      of debt hanging round his neck. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for those confounded
      Oxford bills checking me at first starting, &rsquo;pon my word I don&rsquo;t
      know that I might not have done something. I had ideas about a
      parliamentary career at one time, I can assure you, or diplomacy&mdash;any
      fool&rsquo;s good enough for an <i>attaché</i>. Now, if I had that poor boy&rsquo;s
      fortune, and he had my <i>mis</i>fortune, what an advantage it would be to
      both of us; he&rsquo;ll never know what to do with his money, and I should&mdash;rather!
      Just fancy me with £10,000 a year, and a coat on my back that was paid
      for. By Jove, I should not know myself. Ah, well! it&rsquo;s no use talking
      about it; all the same, I am an unlucky beggar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposed Lewis eagerly, &ldquo;if you really dislike the life you lead
      so much, why don&rsquo;t you break through all these trammels of conventionality
      and strike out some course for yourself? With £800 a year to ward off
      poverty, and the interest you might command, what a splendid career lies
      before you! Were I in your position, instead of desponding I should deem
      myself singularly fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you might, my dear fellow,&rdquo; returned Leicester, after pausing for a
      minute to regard Lewis with a smile of languid wonder. &ldquo;So you might with
      your talents, and&mdash;and wonderful power of getting up the steam and
      keeping it at high pressure. I dare say we should see you a Field Marshal
      if you took to the red cloth and pipe-clay trade; or on the woolsack if
      you preferred joining the long-robed gentlemen. Now, I haven&rsquo;t got that
      sort of thing in me: I was born to be a man of property, and nothing else;
      and the absurdity of the thing is the bringing a man into the world fit
      only for one purpose, and then placing him in a position in which, to use
      the cant of the day, he can&rsquo;t &lsquo;fulfil his mission&rsquo; at any price. It&rsquo;s just
      as if nature were to form a carnivorous animal, and then turn it out to
      grass.&rdquo; Having delivered himself of this opinion with the air of a deeply
      injured man, the Honourable Charles Leicester consulted a minute Geneva
      watch with an enamelled back, and replacing it in his waistcoat pocket,
      continued, &ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock; I shall just have time to smoke a cigar before
      it is necessary to dress for dinner. I presume tobacco is a contraband
      article in the interior of this respectable dwelling-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A salutary dread of Miss Livingstone&rsquo;s indignation has prevented me from
      ever trying such an experiment,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t run the risk of offending the good lady,&rdquo; replied
      Leicester. &ldquo;Aunt Martha has a wonderful knack of blighting the whole
      family for the rest of the day if one happens to run against one of her
      pet prejudices. By the way, you must have found her a most interesting
      companion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are great friends, I can assure you,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis. &ldquo;She condescends
      to patronise me most benignantly; but I have not spoken half-a-dozen times
      with her in as many months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she has enlightened you as to the events about to come off
      during the next three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. Beyond the fact of the General&rsquo;s return, and the information
      that the house was to be filled with people, Miss Livingstone has allowed
      me to remain in a state of the most lamentable ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! have not you heard that the county is vacant, and the General has
      been persuaded to allow himself to be nominated as a candidate on the
      conservative interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought he was already member for the borough of A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he will resign that if he succeeds for the county. Oh, you&rsquo;re quite
      in the dark, I see; we mean to stir heaven and earth to get him in. My
      father gives him all his interest&mdash;Bellefield is coming down to look
      up the tenantry. You know we (that is, Belle and the Governor, worse luck)
      have large estates in the county. Belle can do a little bit of love-making
      in between whiles, and so kill two birds with one stone. And who else do
      you think is coming?&mdash;a very great man, I can assure you; no less a
      personage, in fact, than&mdash;ar&mdash;<i>the</i> De Grandeville! He has
      been induced to&mdash;ar&mdash;&rdquo; (and here he mimicked De Grandeville&rsquo;s
      pompous manner inimitably) &ldquo;throw his little influence&mdash;ar&mdash;into
      the scale, and&mdash;ar&mdash;show himself on the hustings, and&mdash;ar&mdash;arrange
      one or two matters which will in fact&mdash;ar&mdash;render the thing
      secure! The plain truth being that he really is a good man of business,
      and the General has engaged him as an electioneering agent. Well, then,
      there are a lot of people coming besides; and balls and dinners will be
      given to half the county. In short, the General means to do the thing in
      style, and spend as much money as would keep me out of debt for the next
      three years. Several parties are to arrive to-morrow, so the General
      brought Annie and me down with him as a sort of advanced guard. There will
      be some fun, I dare say; but an awful deal of trouble to counterbalance
      it. I shall lose my cigar, though, if I stand gossiping here any longer.
      Let me see, the nearest way to the stables will be to jump out of that
      window; deduct the distance saved from the amount of exertion in leaping,
      and the remainder will be the gain of a minute and a half. Well, time is
      precious, so off we go. I suppose you appear in the course of the evening?
      Take care, Walter; that is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, he flung open the window, sprang out with more agility than
      from his usual listless movements might have been expected, pulled the
      sash down again, and having nodded good-naturedly to Walter, disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant felt and expressed himself greatly delighted at the marked
      improvement which had taken place in his ward&rsquo;s manner and appearance, and
      attributing it with justice to Lewis&rsquo;s judicious management, that young
      gentleman rose many degrees in his employer&rsquo;s favour. The General was
      essentially a practical man&mdash;he was endowed with a clear head, and
      (save where prejudice interfered) a sound judgment, and being happily
      devoid of that inconvenient organ, a heart (whence proceed, amongst other
      reprehensible emigrants, the whole host of amiable weaknesses, which
      merely gain for their proprietor that most useless, because unsaleable,
      article&mdash;affection), he looked upon his fellow-creatures as machines,
      and weighing them in the balance, patronised those only who were not found
      wanting. Lewis had proved himself a good teaching machine, and the General
      valued him accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great point now, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to endeavour to expand
      your pupil&rsquo;s mind. You have developed in him (and I give you great credit
      for the degree of success you have attained) powers of acquiring
      knowledge,&mdash;those powers must be cultivated; he must have
      opportunities afforded him of seeing people and amassing facts for
      himself; and to this end it is my wish that he should mix as much as
      possible in society. I am about to entertain a large party at Broad-hurst,
      and I conceive that it will be a desirable opportunity to accustom Sir
      Walter to the presence of strangers, and to enable him, by the force of
      example acting on his imitative powers, to acquire the manners and habits
      of those of his own rank. I therefore propose that after two o&rsquo;clock on
      each day your pupil and yourself should join the family circle and enter
      into any schemes for amusement or exercise which may be arranged. I
      consider myself most fortunate,&rdquo; continued the General, with a little
      patronising inclination of the head towards Lewis, &ldquo;in having secured the
      services of a gentleman whom I can with such entire satisfaction present
      to my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In compliance with this injunction Lewis was forced, much against his
      will, to withdraw from the retirement under the shadow of which he had
      hitherto contrived to screen himself from those annoyances to which his
      dependent situation exposed him, and which his sensitive nature led him
      especially to dread. On the following day arrivals succeeded one another
      with great rapidity, and when Lewis joined the party after luncheon there
      were several faces with which he was unacquainted. One, however,
      immediately arrested his attention, and turning to Leicester, he inquired
      the name of the person in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! who is the man with moustaches, did you say? What! don&rsquo;t you know
      him?&rdquo; exclaimed Leicester, if, indeed, the slow, languid manner in which
      that young gentleman was accustomed to promulgate his sentiments can be
      properly so termed. &ldquo;How very odd! I thought everybody knew <i>him</i>;
      that&rsquo;s my <i>frère aîné</i> Bellefield; come with me, and I&rsquo;ll introduce
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; returned Lewis, drawing back with a flushed cheek as the
      recollection of the scene on the banks of the Serpentine came vividly
      before him. &ldquo;I had no idea it was your brother; I never imagined for a
      moment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Arundel, don&rsquo;t excite yourself; as a general rule, there&rsquo;s
      nothing in this life worth getting up the steam about,&rdquo; returned
      Leicester, drawing on a kid glove. &ldquo;Bellefield will be extremely happy to
      make your acquaintance&mdash;in fact, he is always extremely happy. If you
      were to cut your throat before his very eyes he would be extremely happy,
      and if he thought you did it well, probably fold his arms, ask what you
      would take for the razor, and be extremely happy to buy it of you. But as
      he&rsquo;ll be constantly here, there exists a positive necessity for you to know
      him&mdash;so come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, Charley Leicester linked his arm in that of Lewis and carried
      him off, <i>nolens volens</i>, to be introduced to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield having seen Lewis only once before, and under very
      peculiar circumstances, did not immediately recognise him; and having made
      up his mind that for electioneering purposes it was necessary to bear all
      species of social martyrdom amiably, underwent his introduction to Lewis
      with great resignation, curling up his moustaches and showing his white
      teeth in a ready-made smile&mdash;of which article he had always a stock
      on hand&mdash;most condescendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s was, however, a face that once seen it was not easy to forget.
      Moreover, there was at that moment an expression gleaming in his dark eyes
      not altogether consistent with the conventional indifference befitting a
      mere social introduction, and Lord Bellefield was too close an observer
      not to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a strange idea I&rsquo;ve seen you somewhere before, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am not much mistaken,&rdquo; returned Lewis, &ldquo;your lordship once did me
      the honour,&rdquo; and he laid a slightly sarcastic emphasis on the words, &ldquo;to
      offer me a sum of money for a favourite dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in Lewis&rsquo;s manner as he uttered these words which
      showed that he had neither forgotten nor forgiven the insult that had been
      offered him. Lord Bellefield perceived it, and replied, with a half-sneer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I recollect now&mdash;you jumped into the water to fish him out; and
      I naturally imagined that, as you appeared to set such store by him, you
      must expect to make money of him. Have you got him still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis replied in the affirmative, and his lordship continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you your own price for him any day you like to name the
      sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for an answer he turned away and began conversing in an
      undertone with his cousin Annie.

      CHAPTER XX.&mdash;SOME OF THE CHARACTERS FALL OUT AND OTHERS FALL IN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;S</span>o! you&rsquo;re old
      acquaintances, it seems!&rdquo; observed Leicester, who had overheard the
      conversation following upon Lewis&rsquo;s introduction to Lord Bellefield.
      &ldquo;Frere told me about the dog business, but I never knew till now that it
      had been Bellefield who offered you money for him. I can see you were
      annoyed about it. Belle fancies money can buy everything (which is pretty
      true in the long run), and a dog is a dog to him and nothing more. He&rsquo;d
      never dream of making a friend of one; in fact, he votes friendship a bore
      altogether; so you must not heed his insult to Herr Faust. What are people
      going to do this afternoon? I wish somebody would settle something. Annie,
      just attend to me a minute, will you&mdash;what are we going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa talked of a skating party on the lake,&rdquo; returned Annie, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve
      had no definite orders. Where can papa be? Do go and look for him,
      Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he in the house, think you?&rdquo; inquired Charles, rising languidly and
      gazing round with a look of dreamy helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw General Grant cross the lawn with a gentleman&mdash;Mr. De
      Grandeville, I believe&mdash;not five minutes since,&rdquo; observed Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; then as you know where to find him, Arundel, and I don&rsquo;t, I dare
      say you&rsquo;ll be kind enough to tell him that&mdash;what was it, Annie?&rdquo; said
      Leicester, reseating himself in an easy-chair with an expression of
      intense relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley, how idle you are! I am quite ashamed of you,&rdquo; exclaimed Annie
      vehemently; then, turning to Lewis, she continued, &ldquo;If you would be so
      kind, Mr. Arundel, as to ask papa whether the lake scheme holds good, and
      if we are to walk or drive there, I should be so much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis signified his willingness to execute her wishes, and calling to
      Walter to accompany him, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Annie, how do you like Lewis Arundel by this time?&rdquo; inquired her
      cousin. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I right in telling you he was quite a catch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; returned Annie warmly; &ldquo;and he is so kind and clever about
      that poor Walter, I don&rsquo;t know what we should do without him. I think it
      is quite delightful to see his manner towards him, poor boy! it combines
      all the tenderness of a woman with the firmness of a man, he is so patient
      and forbearing; but it must in some degree repay him for his trouble to
      see the improvement he has effected, and the strong affection he has
      inspired. Walter absolutely seems to dote upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most desirable acquisition, certainly, the affection of an idiot,&rdquo;
       observed Lord Bellefield with a satirical curl of the lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never despise real affection of any kind,&rdquo; returned Annie quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear you say so, <i>belle cousine</i>,&rdquo; replied Lord
      Bellefield, fixing his bold, roving eyes on her with an expression
      intended to be fascinating, but which was simply disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie looked annoyed, and saying she must warn Miss Livingstone of the
      intended expedition, rose and quitted the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the brothers were left together, Charles, after a minute&rsquo;s pause,
      began&mdash;&ldquo;I say, Bellefield, I wish you&rsquo;d try and be a little more
      civil to young Arundel. You annoyed him by the way in which you offered
      money for his dog, just after he had risked his life to save it, and I
      don&rsquo;t think you mended matters by what you added to-day. Recollect he&rsquo;s a
      gentleman by birth, and has the feelings of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse his feelings!&rdquo; was the unamiable rejoinder; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a proud, insolent
      young puppy. If he&rsquo;s a gentleman by birth, he&rsquo;s a beggar by position, and
      requires pulling down to his proper level. I&rsquo;ve no notion of dependents
      giving themselves such airs, and shall let him know my opinion some of
      these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley Leicester regarded his elder brother with a half-sleepy look of
      serio-comic disgust, then slightly shrugging his shoulders, he drew on his
      glove, placed his hat on his head, arranged his curls to his satisfaction
      at a mirror, and lounged gracefully out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he done so when the late subject of their conversation
      entered by another door which opened into the conservatory, and glanced
      round the apartment as if in quest of some one. Apparently the object of
      his search was not to be discerned, for turning to Lord Bellefield, he
      inquired &ldquo;whether he could direct him where to find Miss Grant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person addressed favoured him for some seconds with a supercilious
      stare ere he answered, &ldquo;And what might you want with that young lady,
      pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis paused for a moment before he dared trust himself to reply, for the
      tone in which the question had been asked was most insolent. At length he
      said, &ldquo;I can have no objection to gratify your lordship&rsquo;s curiosity. The
      General wished me to inform Miss Grant that he had arranged a skating
      party on the lake for this afternoon, and that carriages would be at the
      door in ten minutes to transport those of the company thither who might
      prefer driving to walking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you must possess a wonderful memory, Mr. Arundel; I dare swear
      those were the General&rsquo;s very words. As, however, I can scarcely imagine
      it consistent with your onerous duties to play the part of squire to
      dames, I&rsquo;ll save you the trouble for once, by delivering your message
      myself.&rdquo; And with an irritating smile, as he remarked the anger his words
      had produced, Lord Bellefield turned and quitted the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis stood for a moment gazing after the retreating figure, his chest
      heaving and his nostrils expanded, like those of some hunted animal; then
      pacing the room (his invariable custom when labouring under strong
      excitement), he gave vent to the following broken sentences:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He meant to insult me&mdash;his words, his look, everything proves it&mdash;and
      I did not resent it. Perhaps he thinks I fear him&mdash;if I believed so,
      I&rsquo;d follow him, and before them all fix on him the blow of shame that he
      must avenge, or own himself a coward.&rdquo; As he spoke he took two or three
      hasty strides towards the door; checking himself, however, as his eye
      accidentally fell upon Walter, who had entered with him, and who stood
      regarding him with looks of stupid amazement, he continued: &ldquo;But I must
      not think of myself only; the interests of others are at stake&mdash;Rose&mdash;my
      Mother&mdash;that poor boy&mdash;I dare not sacrifice them.&rdquo; He flung
      himself into a chair, and pressing his hand against his burning brow,
      resumed, &ldquo;Oh, why am I called upon to bear this?&mdash;how have I sinned,
      that this degradation should be forced upon me?&mdash;the coward! he knows
      I am bound hand and foot, or he dare not thus insult me; it is like
      striking a fettered man&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, then added, &ldquo;Well, a time may
      come when I may meet him more as an equal; at all events, now it is my
      duty to bear as much as human nature can, and I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; He remained
      silent for a few minutes, with his hand over his eyes, waiting till the
      excitement should pass away. From this state he was aroused by feeling
      something touch him, and looking up, he perceived the idiot, half
      kneeling, half sitting by his side, gazing up into his face with looks of
      wonder and sympathy. This mute evidence of affection acted as a balm to
      his wounded spirit, and laying his hand kindly on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, he
      said, &ldquo;Walter, my poor fellow, have I frightened you? I was not angry with
      <i>you</i>, you know. Come, we will walk down to the lake and see the
      skating. What has become of Faust, I wonder? We must take him with us, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that who went away just now?&rdquo; returned Walter. &ldquo;He with the hair
      over his mouth, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Lord Bellefield, your friend Mr. Leicester&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad man, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you think so, Walter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy paused for a few moments in reflection, then answered, &ldquo;His eyes
      look wicked and frighten me; besides, he made you angry&mdash;I hate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not say that, Walter; you know it is not right to hate any
      one,&rdquo; returned Lewis, feeling dreadfully hypocritical; then linking his
      arm in that of his pupil, they passed out through the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sound of their retreating footsteps died away a figure peeped
      timidly into the apartment, and seeing it was untenanted, entered and
      gazed after them long and fixedly. It was Annie Grant, who, returning to
      learn the result of Lewis&rsquo;s embassy to her father, had involuntarily
      overheard both the insult and the burst of wounded feeling which it had
      called forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that short five minutes were sown seeds that, as they grew to maturity,
      bore sleepless nights and weary days, and the tearless sorrow of a
      breaking heart, as a portion of their bitter fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lake in Broadhurst Park presented a gay scene on the afternoon in
      question. The General, anxious to propitiate the good-will of the voters,
      had ordered the park to be thrown open to all who might choose to witness
      or join in the amusement of skating. A sharp frost, which had continued
      without intermission for several days, had covered the water with a firm
      coating of ice, which afforded a surface as smooth as glass for the
      evolutions of the skaters. The sun was shining brightly, bringing out
      beautiful effects of light and shade on the steep and rugged banks, and
      causing the hoar-frost on the feathery branches of a young birch
      plantation to glitter like sprays of diamonds. On the side approached by
      the drive from the house a tent had been pitched, in such a direction that
      any of the party who feared to expose themselves to the cold might witness
      the performances of the skaters and yet be sheltered from the troublesome
      intrusion of the north wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis and Walter came in sight of the spot (on which several groups of
      well-dressed people, together with a considerable number of a lower class,
      were already assembled) the latter uttered an exclamation of delight, and
      roused out of his usual state of apathy by the novel excitement, bounded
      gaily forward till he reached the side of Charles Leicester, to whom he
      had taken an extreme fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arundel is going to teach me how to skate, Mr. Leicester, and you are
      to help,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as soon as he had recovered breath after his run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; returned Leicester with a good-natured smile &ldquo;How do you know that
      I will help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Mr. Arundel said so; and everybody minds him&mdash;Faust and
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true, Arundel? Am I to do just as you tell me?&rdquo; inquired
      Leicester, as the individual alluded to joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite right that Walter should think so, at all events,&rdquo; returned
      Lewis; &ldquo;but I told him to ask you, as a favour, whether you would lend us
      your assistance. Walter is anxious to learn to skate, and to save his
      cranium from getting a few artificial bumps suddenly developed upon it, I
      propose that you and I should each take one of his arms and keep him from
      falling, till he learns to stand safely upon his skates without
      assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leicester gave vent to a deep sigh of resignation, then muttered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should certainly never have dreamed of undergoing such an amount
      of exertion on my own account; but I suppose Walter fancies it will be
      very charming, and he has not a great many pleasures, poor fellow!&rdquo; he
      continued aside. And so, like a good-natured, kind-hearted creature, as,
      despite his affectation, he really was, he performed the service required
      of him, and actually exerted himself till his complexion became, as he
      expressed it, &ldquo;redder than that of some awful ploughboy.&rdquo; After a time
      Walter grew tired with the unaccustomed exercise, and taking off his
      skates, the trio proceeded to join the party at the tent. As they
      approached, Annie tripped up to Leicester, and seizing his arm, said,
      &ldquo;Where have you been all this time? I wanted you particularly.&rdquo; She then
      added something in a low voice which had the effect of heightening her
      cousin&rsquo;s unromantic complexion to a still greater degree, and elicited
      from him the incredulous ejaculation, &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be surprised,&rdquo; returned Annie, laughing. &ldquo;She is going to
      remain here till the party breaks up, so you&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to
      make yourself agreeable, if it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;too much trouble,&rsquo; or &lsquo;such a
      bore,&rsquo;&rdquo; she continued, mimicking Charles&rsquo;s languid drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was this matter brought about, pray?&rdquo; inquired her cousin; &ldquo;and why
      on earth do you fancy it concerns me in any way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all my doing,&rdquo; returned Annie. &ldquo;I was not blind when we were in
      Scotland; and after you left us I made a point of cultivating the young
      lady, and fortunately for you, approving of her, I asked papa to let me
      invite her to Broadhurst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, with that discretion which is such a striking characteristic
      of your amiable sex, imparting to him all your views in doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Charley, you are very cross and unkind and disagreeable. I asked her
      merely because I thought it would give you pleasure; and though I like
      sometimes to tease you a little myself, of course I never dreamed of
      saying anything to my father which could annoy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are a dear, good little cousin, I know, so I won&rsquo;t scold you,&rdquo;
       was the reply, and they entered the tent together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes afterwards Lewis was engaged in pointing out to Walter one
      of the skaters who was performing some very intricate figure with great
      success, when he heard a female voice exclaim, &ldquo;Surely I am not mistaken&mdash;that
      is Mr. Arundel!&rdquo; and turning at the sound, beheld, leaning on the arm of
      Charles Leicester, Miss Laura Peyton, the young lady who had penetrated
      his disguise at Lady Lombard&rsquo;s party. Not to return her bow was
      impossible; but at the recollection of all that had passed on that evening
      his cheek flushed and his features assumed a cold, haughty expression, the
      result of mingled pride and vexation, under which he strove to conceal his
      annoyance. Annie, who was not aware that Lewis and her friend had ever met
      before, glanced from one to the other with looks of the greatest
      astonishment, which was by no means diminished when Miss Peyton continued,
      &ldquo;Now let me inquire after the Prince of Persia. I hope you left his
      Highness in the enjoyment of good health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Lewis was striving to frame a suitable reply, Annie, who could
      restrain herself no longer, exclaimed, in a tone of the utmost
      bewilderment, &ldquo;The Prince of Persia! My dear Laura, are you out of your
      senses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only reply her friend was able for some minutes to return was rendered
      inaudible by a fit of laughing, in which Leicester, and at last even Lewis
      himself, could not resist joining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I call that abominable,&rdquo; continued Annie; &ldquo;you are all enjoying some
      excellent joke, and I am left to pine in ignorance. Laura, what <i>are</i>
      you laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Mr. Leicester,&rdquo; returned Miss Peyton, breathless with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles, what is it all about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Arundel,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;he is the proper person to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arundel, you <i>must</i> tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I must beg you to excuse me,&rdquo; began Lewis. &ldquo;Miss Peyton&mdash;that
      is&mdash;Mr. Leicester&mdash;in fact, it is utterly impossible for me to
      tell you. Come, Walter, you&rsquo;ve rested quite long enough, you&rsquo;ll catch cold
      sitting still, after making yourself so hot;&rdquo; and as he spoke he took his
      pupil&rsquo;s arm and hastily quitted the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course as soon as he was out of earshot, Annie reiterated her demand
      that the mystery should be explained, and of course Laura begged Charles
      to relate the affair, and then, woman-like, interrupted him before he had
      uttered half-a-dozen words, and being once fairly off, did not stop till
      she had told the whole history from beginning to end, which she did with
      much spirit and drollery; then, in her turn, she had to be informed of the
      position Lewis held in the General&rsquo;s family; how wonderfully Walter had
      improved under his care, and how much everybody liked him. When they had
      fully discussed these matters, they were joined by Lord Bellefield, who
      escorted them across the ice to witness more closely the proceedings of
      the skaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the afternoon a party of young men had undertaken to skate a
      quadrille. This being something new, people hurried from all sides to
      witness the performance, and a crowd speedily collected. Walter had
      expressed a wish to see it, and Lewis, pleased at the unusual interest he
      took in all that was going forward, which he rightly regarded as a proof
      of the decided progress his intellect was making, willingly complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd still continued to thicken as the quadrille proceeded, and it
      had just occurred to Lewis that the weight of so many people collected in
      one spot would try the strength of the ice pretty severely, when a slight
      cracking sound confirmed his suspicions, and induced him to withdraw
      Walter from the group. It was fortunate that he did so, for scarcely were
      they clear of the crowd when a sharp crack, like the report of a pistol,
      rang in his ears, followed in rapid succession by one or two similar
      explosions. Then came a rush of many feet, accompanied by the shrill
      screaming of women, and on looking round Lewis perceived that a portion of
      the ice had given way, and that several persons were struggling in the
      water.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;FAUST GETS ON SWIMMINGLY, AND THE READER IS INTRODUCED
      TO A DIVING BELLE &ldquo;WRINGING&rdquo; WET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he shrieks alluded
      to in the last chapter still continued, and Lewis, consigning Walter to
      the care of a servant, hastened to the spot to render any assistance which
      it might be in his power to afford. As he reached the scene of action the
      panic and confusion were so great that it was no easy matter to ascertain
      the extent of the mischief, or to perceive how best it might be remedied.
      Lord Bellefield, who seemed the only person at all collected, was issuing
      directions in a loud, authoritative voice, to which the majority of the
      bystanders appeared too much alarmed and excited to pay attention. The
      number of persons who were actually immersed had been increased by the
      injudicious attempts of those who had first endeavoured to assist them by
      rushing to the edge of the broken ice, which, giving way under their
      weight, had plunged them also into the water. As Lewis came up a rope was
      flung across the opening, and held tightly by men on either side. Grasping
      this firmly with one hand, the young tutor assisted to extricate several
      persons who were clinging to the edges of the ice. He was just springing
      back as the portion on which he was standing broke away beneath his feet,
      when a cry was raised, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady in the water!&rdquo; and immediately some
      one added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the General&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;it&rsquo;s Miss Grant.&rdquo; Before the
      words were well spoken Lewis had flung off his greatcoat and was about to
      plunge into the water, when his eye suddenly caught that of Lord
      Bellefield, who, having in the confusion accidentally stationed himself by
      his side, was pointing with vehement gestures to the spot where, partly
      sustained by the buoyant nature of her dress, partly supported by a mass
      of floating ice, the form of Annie Grant was to be discerned. At the sight
      of the eager face of the man who had insulted him some evil spirit seemed
      to take possession of Lewis&rsquo;s breast; checking himself suddenly, he
      stepped back a pace, and fixing his eyes with a piercing glance on Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s features, said coldly, &ldquo;I beg pardon, your lordship will, of
      course, rescue Miss Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment anger and surprise deprived Lord Bellefield of the power of
      speaking, but as soon as he could find words he replied, &ldquo;Go on, sir; as
      you could risk your life for a dog, you will surely take a cold bath to
      save your master&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speech was an ill-chosen one, for it excited a degree of irritation
      which outweighed all other considerations, and folding his arms across his
      chest, Lewis replied in a tone of the bitterest irony, &ldquo;Your lordship must
      excuse me. <i>I am no squire of dames</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s only rejoinder was an oath, and flinging off his
      wrapper, he appeared about to spring into the water. Suddenly changing his
      intention, he turned to Lewis and exclaimed, his face livid with rage and
      vexation, &ldquo;Ten thousand curses on you! You know I cannot swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is at such moments as these, when by our own wilful act we have laid
      ourselves open to his attacks, that the tempter urges us on to crimes
      which in our calmer moments we should shudder to contemplate. A glance of
      triumph shot from Lewis&rsquo;s dark eyes; the fearful thought flashed across
      him, &ldquo;She is to be his bride&mdash;her fortune is to repair his
      extravagance&mdash;perhaps he loves her&mdash;let him save her himself, I
      will not rescue her <i>for him</i>.&rdquo; And the fiend prompted the idea,
      worthy of its originator, that he might revenge himself on Lord Bellefield
      by leaving Annie to perish. But, like many other clever people, for once
      the demon outwitted himself, the very magnitude of the offence serving to
      awaken Lewis to the sinfulness of the line of conduct he had meditated.
      Almost in the same moment in which the idea occurred to him a mist seemed
      to clear itself away from his mental vision, and he perceived the abyss of
      guilt on the brink of which he was standing. And now the agonising doubt
      suggested itself to him whether his repentance might not have come too
      late&mdash;whether Annie might not sink before he could reach her; and as
      Lord Bellefield ran off impetuously to hasten the movements of a party who
      were bringing a small flat-bottomed boat towards the spot, Lewis sprang
      into the water, clearing a quarter of the distance in his leap, and swam
      with vigorous strokes in the direction of the still floating figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fears were not unfounded. Annie&rsquo;s dress, which had hitherto served in
      great measure to sustain her, was rapidly becoming saturated with water;
      every instant she sank lower, and while he was still some yards from the
      spot, to his horror he perceived the fragment of ice on which she rested
      roll round and slip from her grasp. The effect was instantaneous. Uttering
      a piercing shriek, which rang through his ears like a death-knell, she
      threw out her arms in a vain attempt to save herself, and disappeared
      beneath the water. At the same moment there was a rush, a bound, a plunge&mdash;some
      large animal dashed past Lewis, and ere the last fragment of Annie&rsquo;s dress
      disappeared Faust had seized it in his mouth and prevented its wearer from
      sinking. The bystanders now drew the rope which had been flung across the
      opening in the ice in such a direction that Lewis could grasp it, and thus
      supported, he contrived to raise Annie&rsquo;s head above the water, and with
      some assistance from Faust, to keep both her and himself afloat till such
      time as the punt should arrive. This, fortunately, was not long. The
      instant it was launched, Lord Bellefield and one or two others jumped into
      it, and in another moment Annie Grant was rescued from her perilous
      situation, to the horrors of which she was, however, by this time happily
      insensible. As they were lifting her into the boat, poor Faust, who
      probably did not understand that his services were no longer needed, still
      retained his hold on her dress, and Lord Bellefield struck him so fiercely
      with the handle of a boathook that he fell back stunned, and would have
      sunk had not Lewis, who was still in the water, thrown his arm round him
      and supported him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The punt can hold no more,&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Bellefield. &ldquo;Miss Grant&rsquo;s
      safety must not be endangered for <i>any</i> consideration and as he spoke
      he pushed the boat from the spot, leaving Lewis still clinging to the rope
      and supporting the weight of the dog, which did not as yet begin to show
      any signs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will bring the boat back for you, sir, directly&rdquo; cried one of the men
      who were assisting Lord Bellefield in punting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be quick about it, if you care to be of any use,&rdquo; returned Lewis
      in a faint voice, &ldquo;for I can&rsquo;t hold on much longer; my limbs are becoming
      numbed with the cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better let go the dog if you&rsquo;re in any difficulty,&rdquo; suggested Lord
      Bellefield with a malicious laugh as the boat moved rapidly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the way they would repay your faithful service, eh! my poor
      Faust,&rdquo; murmured Lewis. &ldquo;Never fear, we&rsquo;ll sink or swim together, my dog.
      If any one deserves to drown for this day&rsquo;s work &rsquo;tis I, not you.&rdquo;
       At the sound of his master&rsquo;s voice the poor animal opened his eyes and
      began to show signs of returning animation. Fortunate was it for them both
      that Lewis had contrived to place the rope under his arms in such a
      position as almost entirely to support, not only his own weight, but that
      of the dog also; for long before the boat returned his strength was
      entirely exhausted, and his limbs, from the length of time he had been
      immersed in the icy water, had completely lost all sensation, and were
      powerless as those of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield contrived to detain the boat on various pretexts, till at
      last the man who had promised to return lost all patience, and pushed off
      without waiting for permission; in another moment it was by Lewis&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the dog first,&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis in a voice scarcely audible from
      exhaustion. &ldquo;Now, you must lift me in, for I can&rsquo;t help myself.&rdquo; With some
      difficulty (for even with the assistance of the rope Lewis had been barely
      able to keep his own head and that of Faust above water) the men in the
      boat complied with his directions. The dog had by this time nearly
      recovered from the effects of the blow, and was able to stand up and lick
      his master&rsquo;s face and hands as he lay at the bottom of the punt. Lewis,
      however, by no means appeared in such good case; his cheeks and even lips
      were deadly pale, his breathing was hard and laborious, and he lay with
      his eyes closed and his limbs stretched out with unnatural stiffness and
      rigidity. As the boat approached the spot where a landing was practicable,
      Charles Leicester, who had assisted his brother in conveying Annie to the
      carriage, which was fortunately in waiting, came running back, and as his
      eye fell upon the prostrate form of Lewis, he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Arundel! good heavens, I believe he&rsquo;s insensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor was he wrong. The instant the necessity for exertion was over the
      reaction had been too much for Lewis, and he had fainted. He was instantly
      lifted from the boat and carried to the tent, where such restoratives as
      could be at the moment procured were applied, at first without success,
      but after a short time the colour began to return to his lips, and in a
      few minutes more he was restored to consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; began Charley Leicester, as Lewis, with a faint
      smile, sat upright and returned his hearty shake of the hand with a feeble
      pressure. &ldquo;You begin to look a little less like a candidate for a coffin
      than you did five minutes ago. I declare, when I saw you in the boat,
      thought it was a case of &lsquo;found drowned.&rsquo; Faust! good dog, how
      unpleasantly wet you are&mdash;what a bump he&rsquo;s got on the top of his
      head, just where the organ of combativeness&mdash;no, veneration, isn&rsquo;t
      it? ought to be. How did that happen? In fact I&rsquo;m quite in the dark as to
      the whole affair, for I had gone to fetch shawls for some of the ladies,
      and when I reached the scene of action Bellefield was fishing his
      intended, half-drowned, out of a moist punt, and enlisted me to assist in
      conveying the dripping damsel to the carriage. Did you fall in together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will hear enough about it soon, I dare say,&rdquo; returned Lewis, speaking
      feebly and with apparent difficulty. &ldquo;I am afraid I have scarcely
      sufficient life left in me just now to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t attempt it,&rdquo; returned Leicester good-naturedly. &ldquo;And the sooner you
      get those soaked clothes off, the better. Of course they will send back
      the trap for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My carriage is on the spot,&rdquo; interrupted a tall, aristocratic-looking man
      who had assisted in conveying Lewis to the tent. &ldquo;My carriage is on the
      spot, and is very much at this gentleman&rsquo;s service. We must all feel
      anxious to prevent his suffering from the effects of his gallant conduct.
      The preserver of Miss Grant&rsquo;s life must be considered as a public
      benefactor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this praise a slight colour rose to Lewis&rsquo;s pale cheeks, and a look of
      pain passed across his features. <i>He</i> to be styled Annie&rsquo;s preserver!&mdash;<i>he</i>
      who had all but sacrificed her life to his feelings of revenge! and as the
      recollection occurred to him a slight shudder ran through his frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you are actually shivering,&rdquo; exclaimed Leicester. &ldquo;I shall not let
      you stay here any longer. Since Sir Ralph Strickland is so kind as to
      offer his carriage, there is nothing to delay us. Can you walk? Take my
      arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, with an inclination of the head to Sir Ralph, took Leicester&rsquo;s
      proffered arm, and having with difficulty risen from his seat, attempted
      to walk, but at the first step he stumbled, and would have fallen had not
      his friend supported him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, there,&rdquo; continued Leicester; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re hardly in marching order
      yet. Would you like to wait another minute or two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better try to proceed,&rdquo; replied Lewis; &ldquo;exercise may serve
      to restore the circulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to take your other arm,&rdquo; said Sir Ralph Strickland kindly; &ldquo;then
      I think you will be able to reach the carriage&mdash;it is close at hand.
      The length of time you were in the water has cramped your limbs. I saw the
      whole affair, and never witnessed anything more interesting than the
      conduct of your noble dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke he stooped and patted Faust, then forcing Lewis to accept
      his offer of assistance, they left the tent together. As his blood began
      once again to circulate the cramp and stiffness gradually disappeared, and
      ere the trio reached the carriage Lewis scarcely required assistance. On
      reaching Broadhurst he found the General waiting to receive him, and the
      instant he alighted he had to undergo a long, prosy, and pompous harangue,
      embodying that noble commander&rsquo;s gratitude, during the delivery of which
      oration the subject of it was kept standing in his wet clothes, a
      compulsory act of homage to the cold-water system, by no means congenial
      to his feelings, mental or bodily. However, it came to an end at last, and
      Lewis was permitted to retire to his own room. Moreover, Charles Leicester
      (instigated thereunto by a hint from Miss Peyton) waylaid the apothecary
      who had been summoned on Annie&rsquo;s account, and caused him to inspect
      Lewis&rsquo;s condition, which measure resulted in a command to have his bed
      warmed, and instantly to deposit himself therein; with which medical
      ordinance Lewis was fain to comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he lay until, from being much too cold, he became a great deal too
      hot, for before night he was in a high state of feverish excitement,
      accompanied by violent pains in the head and limbs. His medical adviser
      was, however, fortunately really skilful, and by vigorous and timely
      measures he contrived to avert the rheumatic fever with which his patient
      was threatened; and after spending three days in bed Lewis arose, feeling
      indeed especially weak, but otherwise little the worse in body for his
      aquatic exploit. We say in body, for mentally he had suffered, and was
      still suffering bitterly. As he lay on the couch of sickness in the silent
      hours of the night, face to face with conscience, the recollection of the
      sin he had committed (for a sin it was, and he was too honest-hearted in
      his self-scrutiny not to recognise it as such) haunted him. The fact that
      he had been unable by his own act to repair the consequences of the evil
      he had meditated impressed him deeply&mdash;but for Faust Annie would have
      sunk ere he could have reached the spot, probably to rise no more. It
      appeared a special interference of Providence to convince him of the folly
      of self-reliance, and to impress upon his mind a sense of the mercy of
      God, in saving him from the consequences of his revengeful feelings. True,
      he had repented of his fault almost in the moment of committal; true, he
      had risked his life in proof of the sincerity of His repentance; true, the
      provocation he had received might, in the eyes of men, serve in great
      measure to justify him; still, the knowledge that but for the
      interposition of Providence he might now have felt himself a murderer
      filled him with emotions of the deepest penitence, and at the same time of
      the liveliest gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this frame of mind the encomiums passed upon his gallant conduct were
      most distressing to him, and a short note from Annie, thanking him in a
      few simple words for having saved her life, added fuel to the fire of his
      self-condemnation. Amongst other good resolutions for the future he
      determined to bear any insults Lord Bellefield might offer with as much
      patient endurance as could by any possibility be consistent with
      self-respect in one in his dependent situation; and the reader may judge
      of the sincerity of his repentance if he reflects what such a resolution
      must have cost his haughty nature. He also determined to seek an
      opportunity of confessing to Annie how little he deserved her gratitude,
      and to implore her forgiveness for the wrong he had intended her. The
      dipping that young lady had undergone did not appear to have affected
      either her health or her spirits. By the doctor&rsquo;s orders she also had been
      sent to bed immediately on her return home, where, falling asleep, she
      escaped a lecture from Minerva and all other evil consequences of her
      immersion, and woke the next morning none the worse for the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about a week after the day on which these events had taken place,
      when, the afternoon being fine, Lewis and Walter proposed to take a ride
      together. Walter had mounted his pony, and Lewis was strapping a greatcoat
      in front of his horse&rsquo;s saddle, when Richards, the groom, who had been
      elevated to the rank of second coachman (as the illness of the head
      coachman had rendered his resignation an act of necessity, and the next in
      command had succeeded to his vacant box), came forward, and touching his
      hat, asked if he could speak to Lewis a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; what is it?&rdquo; returned Lewis, stepping aside a few paces. &ldquo;Why,
      sir, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you know as the General&rsquo;s gone out a-driving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware of the fact,&rdquo; returned Lewis; &ldquo;but what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-driving of hisself, sir,&mdash;<i>our</i> iron-greys, Mr. Arundel.
      Master ain&rsquo;t so young as he used to was, and it&rsquo;s my belief if any-think
      startles &rsquo;em he won&rsquo;t be able to hold &rsquo;em&mdash;they go
      sweetly now, but they do pull most amazing. I drove &rsquo;em yesterday,
      and afore I got home my arms ached properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you mention this to General Grant?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I told him I was afeard he&rsquo;d find &rsquo;em pull rather stiff; but
      he only give me one of his dark looks, as much as to say, &lsquo;Keep youi
      advice to yourself, and mind your own business.&rsquo; Master&rsquo;s rather a hard
      gentleman to talk to, you see; he&rsquo;s always been used to shooting and
      flogging the blacks, out in the Ingies, till it&rsquo;s kind a-become natural to
      him; and <i>as</i> he can&rsquo;t act the same here with us whites, why it puts
      him out like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see that anything can be done now,&rdquo; observed Lewis, after a
      moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;If I had been here when the General started I would
      have told him the trick the iron-greys played us, and advised him not to
      drive them just yet; but I dare say it would have done no good; for, as
      you say, your master is not over fond of advice gratis. I suppose he has
      one of the grooms with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a mere boy, sir, and Miss Annie,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis in a quick, excited tone of voice; &ldquo;is Miss Grant
      with him? Why did you not say so before? Which road have they taken? How
      long have they been gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twenty minutes, or p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps not so long,&rdquo; returned Richards. &ldquo;I
      think they&rsquo;re gone to Camfield&mdash;leastways, I heard master tell Miss
      Annie to bring her card-case, &rsquo;cos he was going to call on Colonel
      Norton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be eight miles by the road, but not much above five across the
      fields by Churton Wood,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That <i>is</i> right, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and the gates is
      unlocked, for I rode that way with a note for Colonel Norton the day afore
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ere Richards had finished speaking Lewis was on horseback; and as soon as
      they reached the park he turned to his pupil, saying, &ldquo;Now, Walter, sit
      firmly, guide the pony on to the turf, tighten your reins, and then for a
      good canter; touch him with the whip&mdash;not too hard&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
       Putting his own horse in motion at the same time, they rode forward at a
      brisk canter, which, as the horses grew excited by the rapid motion,
      became almost a gallop. Crossing the park at this pace, they turned down a
      bridle-path which led through a wood and across several grass fields,
      beyond the last of which lay a wide common. As they approached this Lewis
      took out his watch. &ldquo;Above four miles in twenty mintues,&mdash;I call that
      good work for a pony. You rode very well, Walter,&mdash;you&rsquo;ve a capital
      seat on horseback now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can leap too,&rdquo; rejoined Walter. &ldquo;Richards taught me the days when you
      were ill in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; returned Lewis, who, while his pupil was speaking,
      had been endeavouring, unsuccessfully, to open a gate, &ldquo;for they have
      fastened this gate with a padlock, and we must find our way over the
      hedge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes you can,&rdquo; interposed Lewis, &ldquo;when I have cleared the road for you,
      and shown you how to do it. Sit still and watch me.&rdquo; So saying, he
      selected a place where the hedge was thin and the ditch and bank
      practicable, and putting his horse into an easy canter, rode at it. Being
      particularly anxious that nothing should go wrong, and that Walter should
      be convinced of the feasibility of the attempt, Lewis was not best pleased
      when his horse, instead of rising to the leap, refused it, and replied to
      a tolerably sharp application of the spur by plunging violently and
      turning short round. His rider, however, sat as firmly as if he were part
      of the animal, and cantering round two sides of the field, got him well in
      hand and again rode him at the hedge, working his mouth with the bit and
      giving him the spur. This discipline produced the desired effect; for
      instead of refusing the leap this time, the horse sprang forward with a
      bound which would have cleared an obstacle of twice the size, and alighted
      on the other side several feet beyond the ditch. Lewis rode on a few
      yards, and then turning, leaped back into the field and rejoined his
      pupil. &ldquo;Now, Walter, you must do as I have done. Canter up to that gap,
      give the pony his head, touch him on the flank as he approaches the hedge,
      sit firmly and press in your knees, and you&rsquo;ll go over as nicely as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But poor Walter&rsquo;s courage failed him; the conflict between Lewis and his
      horse had destroyed his confidence, and he was afraid to make the attempt.
      His tutor read it in his blanched cheek and quailing glance, and being as
      kind and judicious as he was firm, forbore to press the point, and
      dismounting, led the pony through the gap, and assisted Walter to scramble
      over on foot; then remounting his steed, he tested his obedience by once
      more leaping him over; and having thus achieved the adventure of the
      locked gate, tutor and pupil cantered off across the common. But this
      little episode had caused some loss of time, and when Lewis reached the
      lane leading to the village, near which Colonel Norton&rsquo;s house was
      situated, he learned from a man who was mending the road that a phaeton,
      answering the description of General Grant&rsquo;s equipage, had passed a few
      minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Richards&rsquo; fears were needlessly excited then, it seems, and the
      old gentleman is a better whip than he gave him credit for being,&rdquo; thought
      Lewis. &ldquo;Come, Walter,&rdquo; he added aloud, &ldquo;we will go back by the road. Don&rsquo;t
      trot just yet; the horses are warm, we must allow them to get a little
      cool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After proceeding about half a mile along the lane, which was only just
      wide enough to allow vehicles to pass each other, they overtook an elderly
      woman in a red cloak most picturesquely perched between two panniers on a
      donkey&rsquo;s back. Such an arrangement being a novelty to Walter, he was
      proceeding to inquire of what use the panniers were, when Lewis&rsquo;s quick
      sense of hearing caught a sound which caused him to rein in his horse and,
      enjoining silence, pause to listen. His ears had not deceived him. Owing
      to the frosty weather the road was particularly hard, the ruts also had
      been lately mended with coarse gravel, and as he listened the sound of
      horses&rsquo; feet galloping, and the rattle of a carriage proceeding at unusual
      speed, became distinctly audible in the lane behind them. The vehicle was
      evidently rapidly approaching. The lane being in this part extremely
      narrow, Lewis&rsquo;s first thought was for Walter&rsquo;s safety. Seizing the pony&rsquo;s
      rein, he set spurs to his horse, and they cantered on a short distance
      till they reached a gateway leading into a field. The gate was fortunately
      open, and desiring Walter to ride into the field and wait till he joined
      him, he turned his horse&rsquo;s head and began, to retrace his steps. As soon
      as he had passed an old oak-tree which stood at a corner of the road and
      prevented any one from seeing beyond it, he perceived the cause of the
      sounds which had reached him, and which he had already but too correctly
      divined.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about a hundred yards from the spot where he was stationed appeared a
      phaeton drawn by a pair of magnificent iron-grey horses, which Lewis had
      no difficulty in recognising. From the furious pace at which they were
      advancing, it was evident that their driver had lost all control over
      them; while about half-way between Lewis and the equipage in question were
      the donkey and panniers, with the old woman in the red cloak before
      alluded to. The gentleman driving the phaeton shouted to her to get out of
      the way, and Lewis made signs as to which side of the road she had better
      take; but she appeared either paralysed with fear or unable to guide her
      donkey; and ere she was able to comply with, or probably to comprehend
      these directions, the infuriated horses had overtaken her, and dashing
      against her, flung her, donkey, panniers and all, to the ground with a
      shock like that of a battering-ram. At the same instant Lewis, availing
      himself of the temporary check, rode forward, and springing from his
      saddle, seized the heads of the phaeton horses, and with much difficulty,
      and no inconsiderable personal risk, succeeded in stopping them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;THE TRAIN ARRIVES AT AN IMPORTANT STATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he catastrophe
      related at the end of the last chapter attracted the attention of a couple
      of labourers who had been engaged in mending the road, and they
      immediately hastened to the spot to render any assistance which might be
      required. By their aid the poor woman was extricated from her perilous
      situation, and fortunately proved to be less injured than could have been
      expected, a dislocated shoulder being the most serious hurt she had
      sustained. Committing the phaeton and horses to the care of one of the
      working men, Lewis and the other labourer carried the poor woman to a
      cottage by the roadside, and deposited her on a bed till such time as the
      surgeon (for whom General Grant had, by his daughter&rsquo;s suggestion,
      despatched the groom on the horse which Lewis had ridden) should arrive.
      Luckily, they had not long to wait, as the boy met the person he was in
      search of returning from his round of professional visits. The dislocated
      shoulder was soon set to rights and bandaged up, and the sight of Annie&rsquo;s
      well-filled purse rendered easy an arrangement with the tenants of the
      cottage to allow the invalid to continue their inmate till the next day,
      when she could be removed without detriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the General had drawn Lewis on one side, and was
      expatiating to him upon the cause of the accident. &ldquo;You perceive, Mr.
      Arundel, that my wrist is slightly swollen? Well, sir, that is from an old
      strain received in the little affair at Sticumlÿkphun. I was only a
      captain then. The company to which I belonged got separated from the
      regiment in crossing a jungle, and a party of the Rajah&rsquo;s irregular horse
      tried to cut us off; they were upon us so suddenly, we hadn&rsquo;t time to form
      a hollow square, and for a minute our fate appeared sealed;&mdash;they
      rode the men down like sheep. In the <i>mêlée</i> a gigantic trooper cut
      down the colour-sergeant and was about to possess himself of the flag,
      when I seized the staff with my left hand and struck at him with my sabre,
      but, unfortunately, it broke on his cuirass; his sword had also snapped
      with the blow which had caused the sergeant&rsquo;s death, and a struggle ensued
      between us for the possession of the colours. His strength was in
      proportion to his height, but although I felt as if every muscle in my
      arms was about to snap, I held on till one of my men shot him through the
      head. At the same moment a troop of the 14th Lancers rode up and rescued
      us&mdash;but my wrists-have never recovered the strain. However, I found
      little difficulty in holding in these horses, till, just now, when we had
      turned to come home, some boys overthrew a barrow full of stones by the
      roadside, which startled the animals; they broke into a gallop, and
      despite all my efforts to prevent it, the accident to which you were
      witness occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I known of your intention, sir, I should have cautioned you not to
      trust them too implicitly,&rdquo; replied Lewis. &ldquo;Before your return,&mdash;by
      Miss Livingstone&rsquo;s wish,&mdash;I went over the stables to ascertain
      whether there were any carriage horses she could use. I drove these greys
      the second or third time they had ever been in harness, and they ran away
      with me in Broadhurst Park; but I have taken them out several times since,
      when Walter wished for an airing, and I believed they had become quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; returned the General, more graciously than was his wont, &ldquo;I was
      not aware you were so good a whip; that relieves me from a great
      difficulty; you will be so obliging as to drive the phaeton home, and I
      can ride your horse. With my wrists in their present condition it would be
      a great risk for me to attempt to hold in those animals, and the groom is
      a mere boy. Annie, my dear,&rdquo; he continued, as his daughter approached them
      from the cottage, &ldquo;our difficulties are at an end. Mr. Arundel, it
      appears, has been in the habit of driving these horses lately, and will be
      so good as to take my place and see you safely home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, papa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Annie in a tone of remonstrance, while a
      slight accession of colour replaced the roses which fear had banished from
      her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, the arrangement is the only one which appears feasible under
      present circumstances. I shall ride Mr. Arundel&rsquo;s horse and will keep
      near, so you need be under no alarm,&rdquo; returned her father majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie by no means approved of the plan. In the first place, she was a good
      deal afraid of the horses, and having no experience of Lewis&rsquo;s skill as a
      driver, was naturally alarmed at trusting herself again behind them. In
      the second place, she had a vague idea that it was scarcely etiquette to
      take a <i>tête-à-tête</i> drive with the handsome young tutor. But she saw
      that her father was quite determined, so, like a sensible girl, she
      refrained from offering opposition which she foresaw would be useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, however, reading in that &ldquo;book of beauty,&rdquo; her expressive face, the
      secret of her fears, took an opportunity, while the General was altering
      the stirrups to suit himself, to reassure her by saying, &ldquo;You need not be
      in the least afraid, Miss Grant. Believe me, I would not undertake so
      great a trust as that of your safety did I not feel perfectly sure that I
      could drive you home without the slightest danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis spoke Annie raised her eyes and glanced at him for a moment. It
      has been already remarked, in the course of this veracious history, that
      when Lewis smiled, the nameless charm which in Rose Arundel&rsquo;s face won the
      love of all who knew her shed its lustre over his handsome features. To
      analyse such an expression of countenance is scarcely possible, but
      perhaps the nearest approach to a correct description of it would be to
      say that it was a bright, sunshiny look which inspired others with a
      conviction of its wearer&rsquo;s kindliness of heart and honest truthfulness of
      purpose. Such was its effect in the present instance, and when her father
      handed her to her seat in the phaeton the uneasiness which had arisen from
      a want of confidence in her driver had in great measure disappeared. Lewis
      waited, with the reins in his hand, till the General had mounted and
      ridden off with Walter, who acquiesced silently in the change of
      companion, then springing lightly to his place, he desired the man at the
      horses&rsquo; heads to stand aside, and drove off. The iron-greys soon found out
      the difference between their late conductor and their present one, and
      after one or two slight attempts to gain their own way gave up the point
      and settled down into a quiet, steady trot. Annie, whose alarm had
      quickened her perceptions on the subject, was not long in remarking the
      change, and turning to her companion, observed, &ldquo;How do you contrive to
      make the horses go so quietly, Mr. Arundel? When papa was driving them
      they did nothing but dance and caper the whole way, and at last, as you
      are aware, ran away with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, who considered that the present was a favourable opportunity, which
      might never occur again, to unburden his mind in regard to the skating
      affair, and was debating with himself how he might best introduce the
      subject, heard her question mechanically, as it were, without its reaching
      the ears of his understanding, and it was not until he observed her look
      of surprise at receiving no answer to her query that he hastened to reply,
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Grant, I was thinking on quite a different
      subject. I have lived such a hermit&rsquo;s life of late with poor Walter that I
      fear I have become dreadfully absent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely asked by what charm you had contrived to tame these fiery
      steeds,&rdquo; returned Annie, smiling at his evident bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The charm of a steady hand and a strong arm,&rdquo; replied Lewis. &ldquo;But these
      horses and I are old acquaintances; we had a struggle once for the
      mastery, and I conquered, which they have not forgotten.&rdquo; He then gave her
      a short account of the runaway scene in Broad-hurst Park, to which she
      listened with much interest. When he had concluded, Annie remarked, &ldquo;How
      dreadful it must have been when they were rushing towards the lake, and
      you felt uncertain whether you might be able to check their wild career!
      That lake seems destined to become the scene of dangerous adventures. I
      must take this opportunity,&rdquo; she continued with a faint blush, &ldquo;of
      thanking you for saving my life. In the few hurried lines I wrote you, I
      am afraid I scarcely made you understand how much I&mdash;in fact, that I
      am not ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now Lewis&rsquo;s turn to feel embarrassed. The moment he had sought for
      was arrived. He must confess that which would turn his companion&rsquo;s
      gratitude into aversion; he must forfeit her good opinion irretrievably,
      and probably for this very reason (so perverse is human nature), he, for
      the first time, discovered that he valued it highly. Annie was the only
      member of the family (with the exception, perhaps, of Charles Leicester)
      who had never caused him to feel painfully his dependent situation; and it
      had not escaped his notice how on several occasions she had interfered to
      save him from some trifling annoyance, which her woman&rsquo;s tact led her to
      feel would be doubly mortifying to his proud and sensitive nature. Still
      he had resolved to make the confession, and with him to resolve and to do
      were one and the same thing. Another difficulty which rendered his task
      more embarrassing was that, in order to make his explanation intelligible,
      he must revert to Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s insult, and though at that moment
      nothing would have given him greater satisfaction than to bestow on that
      unworthy scion of nobility a sound horse-whipping, he shrank from the idea
      of being supposed capable of the littleness of revenging himself by
      injuring his enemy in the affections of his betrothed. Thinking, however,
      was useless; the more he reflected the more embarrassed did he become, so
      he plunged at once <i>in media res</i> by exclaiming, &ldquo;You cannot be
      aware, Miss Grant, of the pain your words give me. Far from deserving your
      gratitude, I must implore your pardon for having nearly sacrificed your
      life to my unfortunately warm temper and revengeful feelings; nor shall I
      again enjoy peace of mind till I have obtained your forgiveness, should I
      indeed be fortunate enough to succeed in doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this singular address Annie opened her large eyes and regarded her
      companion with unmixed astonishment, feeling by no means satisfied that he
      had not suddenly taken leave of his senses; not heeding her surprise,
      however, Lewis continued: &ldquo;In order to make my tale intelligible, I must
      revert to an occurrence which I would rather, for many reasons, have left
      unmentioned; but you will, I hope, do me the justice to believe that I am
      actuated by no unworthy motive in alluding to it. About a year ago my
      favourite dog became entangled whilst swimming in the Serpentine river,
      and would have been drowned if I had not jumped in and saved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I saw it all; we were driving in the park at the time,&rdquo;
       interrupted Annie eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I regained the bank,&rdquo; resumed Lewis, &ldquo;a gentleman, whom I have since
      learned to be your cousin, Lord Bellefield, came up and offered me a sum
      of money for the dog. I had not accomplished Faust&rsquo;s rescue without some
      risk, for though I am a good swimmer, my wet clothes kept dragging me
      down, and I confess the offer of money for an animal I had just imperilled
      my life to save irritated me, and I returned Lord Bellefield an answer
      which perhaps he was justified in considering impertinent. When Mr.
      Leicester introduced me to his brother, on the day of the skating-party,
      it was evident he had not forgotten this transaction, and he soon found an
      opportunity to address me in a style which could only have been applied to
      a dependent with safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke these words in a tone of bitter contempt, his eyes flashing
      and his cheeks burning, his companion murmured as though she were thinking
      aloud, &ldquo;It was ungenerous of him, in the extreme.&rdquo; Lewis remained silent
      for a moment, and then continued in a calmer voice: &ldquo;I am by nature of a
      lamentably hasty temper, and my impulse would have led me to resent Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s insult on the spot; but many considerations withheld me, and
      still possessed by angry feeling, I joined the party on the lake. After
      the ice had given way, while I was assisting those who clung to the edges
      to scramble out, I first became aware that you were in the water, and I
      was about to jump in and swim to your assistance when, by some ill luck,
      your cousin approached in a state of great excitement and ordered me
      authoritatively to &lsquo;save my master&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how could he say such a thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he spoke,&rdquo; resumed Lewis, &ldquo;some evil spirit seemed to take possession
      of me, and, to annoy him, I bowed and drew back, saying, &lsquo;Your lordship
      must excuse me&mdash;I am no squire of dames;&rsquo; adding that of course he
      would rescue you himself. From the irritation produced by my reply I
      discovered that his lordship was unable to swim, and having reason to
      suppose your safety was especially important to him, the fiendish idea
      crossed my mind that by leaving you to perish I could revenge myself on
      him more effectually than by any other means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you be so unjust, so cruel, even in idea?&rdquo; interrupted Annie
      reproachfully,&mdash;&ldquo;I, who have never injured you in thought, word, or
      deed; but you were maddened at the time, and knew not what you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must indeed have been mad,&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, completely overcome by the
      kindness of these last words, &ldquo;when I could even for a moment forget the
      gentle courtesy with which you have always treated me&mdash;the
      consideration&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused abruptly and pressed his
      hand to his forehead as if to shut out some hateful vision, a relaxation
      of vigilance of which the near-side horse took advantage to shy at its own
      shadow and break into a canter, which manouvre restored Lewis&rsquo;s
      self-possession in an instant, the rein was again tightened, and the
      culprit admonished, by a sharp stroke of the whip, that he was not to
      indulge in such caprices for the future, ere his driver resumed: &ldquo;I had
      scarcely formed the idea you so justly stigmatise as cruel, when the
      atrocity of the act flashed across me, and as Lord Bellefield ran off to
      procure a boat, I sprang into the water and swam towards you. Imagine then
      the agony of mind with which I perceived that you would sink before I
      could reach you! At that moment I felt what it was to be a murderer! The
      rest of the tale you have no doubt heard from others&mdash;how it pleased
      the Almighty to permit the instinct of my noble dog to become the
      instrument by which you were saved from death, and I from a life of
      remorse, to which death itself would have been preferable. Of this you are
      already aware; it only remains for me to add that if the deepest
      self-abhorrence, the most sincere repentance for the past may weigh with
      you, you will forgive me the wrong I meditated.&rdquo; At this moment the sound
      of horses&rsquo; feet cantering gave notice that General Grant was about to
      effect a junction with the main body, and Annie replied hastily, &ldquo;As far
      as I have anything to forgive, Mr. Arundel, I do so most heartily. If for
      a moment you thought of allowing my life to be sacrificed, you risked your
      own to save it immediately afterwards, so that I remain your debtor, even
      putting to-day&rsquo;s adventure out of the account&mdash;for I fully believe
      papa and I were in a fair way to break our necks, though he would not
      allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Annie,&rdquo; remarked the General, riding up to his daughter&rsquo;s side,
      &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t appear to be frightened now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;there is nothing to be alarmed at; the horses
      go as quietly as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I thought I had pretty well tamed them,&rdquo; returned the General
      triumphantly. &ldquo;You scarcely find them at all difficult to restrain now,
      Mr. Arundel, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do pull a little strongly even yet, sir,&rdquo; returned Lewis quietly;
      &ldquo;that glove was whole when I took the reins.&rdquo; As he spoke he held up his
      left hand and disclosed two large rents caused by the friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; replied the General, slightly disconcerted. &ldquo;Well, you have driven
      them very steadily; don&rsquo;t hurry them, take them in cool. Walter and I will
      precede you and explain how this adventure came about.&rdquo; So saying he gave
      his horse the rein, and he and Walter cantered on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Bellefield has behaved abominably,&rdquo; observed Annie abruptly, after
      they had proceeded for some distance in silence; &ldquo;he ought to apologise to
      you, and I have a great mind to make him do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think of such a thing,&rdquo; returned Lewis hastily. &ldquo;If I can read his
      character, Lord Bellefield is a very proud man, and to one whom he
      considers his inferior he could not bring himself to apologise; nor, on
      calmly reviewing my own conduct, can I entirely acquit myself of having
      given him cause of offence. In my manner towards him I have shown too
      plainly my forgetfulness of our difference of station. Feeling that the
      son of one who was a soldier, a man of old family, and a gentleman in the
      highest sense of the word, is any man&rsquo;s equal, I overlooked the
      distinction between the heir to a peerage and a poor tutor, and I treated
      Lord Bellefield, as I would any other man whose manner displeased me,
      cavalierly, without considering, or indeed caring, in what light my
      conduct might appear to him. This error I am resolved to avoid for the
      future, and if he will on his part forbear further insult, it is all I
      desire. Believe me,&rdquo; added Lewis in a tone which carried conviction with
      it, &ldquo;I do not undervalue your kindness in advocating my cause, but I would
      not have you suffer further annoyance on my account; so if you have really
      forgiven me, you will best show it by forgetting the whole matter as
      speedily as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie shook her head as though she considered such a termination to the
      affair highly improbable, merely replying, &ldquo;Perhaps you are right in
      thinking I should do more harm than good by my interference; at all
      events, I will be guided in the matter by your wishes. And now, Mr.
      Arundel,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;let me say what I have often wished, but have
      never been able to find an opportunity to tell you before, and that is,
      that as long as you are with us&mdash;not that I mean to limit it only to
      that time&mdash;I hope you will regard me as a friend. I have heard from
      my cousin Charles an outline of the circumstances through which my father
      was fortunate enough to secure your valuable assistance for poor Walter,
      and I can well conceive how greatly you must feel the loss of the society
      of your mother and sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not how to thank you for such unexampled kindness; you are indeed
      returning good for evil,&rdquo; replied Lewis warmly. He paused for a moment, as
      if he were considering how best he might express his meaning, then added,
      &ldquo;As far as may be, I shall most gladly avail myself of the privilege of
      your friendship. I cannot tell you the weight you have taken off my mind
      by this convincing proof of your forgiveness. You may imagine how
      exquisitely painful, knowing how little I deserved them, were all the
      civil speeches people considered it necessary to make me on my &lsquo;gallant
      conduct,&rsquo; as they termed it; as if there were anything wonderful in
      swimming a few yards to save a life!&mdash;the wonder would be for any man
      who could swim <i>not</i> to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, thinking thus lightly of the peril, you tell me you were so
      carried away by your angry feeling as to hesitate whether or not to leave
      me to perish,&rdquo; returned Annie reflectively. &ldquo;How strange that the mind can
      be engrossed by passion so completely as to banish all its natural
      impulses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will laugh at me, and think my German education has filled my brain
      with strange, wild fancies,&rdquo; replied Lewis; &ldquo;but I believe that we are
      under a species of demoniacal possession at such moments&mdash;that by
      indulging our evil feelings instead of resisting them we have given Satan
      additional power over us. You know the legend of the Wild Huntsman: I
      cannot but look upon the description of the spirit-riders who accompanied
      the baron, one on a white, the other on a black steed, and alternately
      plied him with good and evil counsel, less as an allegory than a reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe, then, that we are constantly surrounded by spiritual beings
      imperceptible to our bodily senses?&rdquo; asked Annie. &ldquo;It is rather a fearful
      idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe,&rdquo; returned Lewis, &ldquo;is perhaps too strong a term to apply to any
      theory not distinctly borne out by Holy Writ, but as far as I have studied
      the subject, I think the existence of spiritual beings of opposite
      natures, some good, some evil, is clearly indicated by Scripture; and
      there are many passages which would lead one to suppose that they are
      permitted, under certain restrictions, to interest themselves in mundane
      affairs, and influence the thoughts which are the springs of human actions&mdash;immaterial
      agents, in fact, for working out the will of God. Nor do I see anything
      fearful in the idea; on the contrary, as we cannot doubt that it is our
      own fault if the evil spirits ever prevail against us, and that good
      angels witness our struggles to do right, and are at hand to assist us, I
      consider the theory a most consolatory one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never looked at the subject in this light before,&rdquo; observed Annie
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;Of course, like most other people, I had a vague, visionary
      kind of belief in the existence of good angels and evil spirits, but I
      never applied the belief practically, never imagined they had anything to
      do with me; and yet it seems reasonable that what you have suggested
      should be the case. Oh! if we could but have our spiritual eyes open so
      that we could see them, we then should love the good angels so much, and
      hate and fear the evil ones to such a degree, that it would be quite easy
      to act rightly, and impossible to do wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, if our faith were as strong as it should be,&rdquo; returned Lewis,
      &ldquo;we ought so to realise the truths of Christianity that we should feel as
      you describe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion made no reply, but sat for some minutes apparently pursuing
      the train of thought to which his words had given rise. At length rousing
      herself, she turned to Lewis, saying, with a <i>naïve</i> smile, &ldquo;We shall
      be capital friends, I see. I did not know you could talk so nicely about
      things of this kind. I delight in people who give me new ideas&mdash;you
      must teach me German, too, when all this bustle is over. I shall ask papa
      to let you do so. I want to learn German above everything, and to read
      Schiller, and Goethe, and La Motte Fouqué, and all sorts of people. Will
      you take compassion on my ignorance, and accept me as a pupil? I shall not
      be quite as dull as poor Walter, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to play Master of the Ceremonies to introduce you to
      those of the German authors who are best worth knowing, always provided
      that the General approves of my so doing,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! papa will approve,&rdquo; replied Annie. &ldquo;He can care nothing about it one
      way or another, and whenever that is the case he always lets me do as I
      like; and as to Aunt Martha&mdash;well, there may be some difficulty with
      her, I confess, but the most ferocious animals are tamed by kindness, and
      it&rsquo;s hard if I can&rsquo;t coax her into submission to my will and pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I flatter myself I have become rather a favourite with Miss Livingstone
      since the affair of the horses,&rdquo; observed Lewis. &ldquo;I have heard her
      describe me as &lsquo;a young man of unusual abilities and irreproachable moral
      character&rsquo; to three distinct sets of visitors during the last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve caught her tone exactly,&rdquo; returned Annie, laughing; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s very
      abominable of you to deride my venerable aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they chatted on, Lewis forgetting alike his proud reserve and his
      dependent position in his pleasure in once again meeting with the kindness
      and sympathy to which he had been so long a stranger, and Annie engrossed
      by the joy with which she perceived the ice that care and sorrow had
      frozen round the heart of her young companion melt before the fascination
      of her look and manner; and when the phaeton drew up before the ample
      portals of Broadhurst, it would have been hard to decide which of the two
      felt most sorry that pleasant drive had come so quickly to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our train still runs along the <i>Railroad of Life</i>, but a most
      important station has been passed when Lewis first arrived at the
      conclusion that he had ceased to dislike Annie Grant.

      CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;DE GRANDEVILLE THREATENS A CONFIDENCE AND ELICITS
      CHARLEY LEICESTER&rsquo;S IDEAS ON MATRIMONY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was the morning
      of Twelfth-day, and in Broadhurst&rsquo;s ancient mansion confusion reigned
      supreme; for Twelfth-night to be celebrated with high festivities. A grand
      ball was about to be given to the county, and legions of upholsterers&rsquo; men
      had taken the house by storm, and were zealously employed in turning it
      out of the windows. Minerva was great upon the occasion; starched to the
      nth, she rustled through the apartments like an austere whirlwind,
      striking an icy terror into the hearts of the stoutest workmen, and
      leading the chief upholsterer himself the life of a convicted felon on the
      treadmill&mdash;solitary confinement, implying separation from Minerva,
      would have been a boon to that harassed tradesman. Whatever he put up she
      instantly had taken down; all his suggestions she violently opposed; he
      never gave an order that she did not contradict; when he was downstairs
      she required him at the top of the house; if he appeared without his hat,
      she took him out of doors. Foxe&rsquo;s Martyrs would seem a mere book of sports
      beside a faithful chronicle of all that upholsterer suffered on the
      occasion at the hands of Minerva Livingstone. Had he not been endowed with
      remarkable tenacity of life, ere he had set that house in order he would
      have died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst others of the dispossessed, Charley Leicester, having retreated
      from room to room before the invaders, at last, fairly driven out, was
      fain to seek refuge in the garden. In this extremity he betook himself to
      a certain terrace-walk, where he trusted to find sunshine and quiet.
      Having, as he fondly imagined, secured these necessary ingredients to his
      happiness, he was proceeding to recruit exhausted nature with a mild
      cigar, when a footstep was heard approaching, and immediately afterwards
      the erect and portly form of <i>the</i> De Grandeville hove in sight and
      bore down upon him. Now it must be known that these two gentlemen regarded
      each other with very different feelings&mdash;Leicester, albeit by no
      means given to discovering faults of character in his acquaintances, could
      not but perceive the absurd self-consequence and pompous pride which were
      so palpably displayed in De Grandeville&rsquo;s every look and action, and while
      this revolted his good taste and produced in him a passive feeling of
      dislike, the style of conversation usually adopted by the redoubtable
      Marmaduke, which, however it might begin, invariably ended in some form of
      self-glorification, actively bored him. Accordingly, it was with anything
      but a feeling of satisfaction that he now witnessed his approach. De
      Grandeville, on the other hand, looked up to Leicester on account of his
      connection with the peerage, and knowing his popularity among the best set
      of men about town, regarded him as an oracle on all points of <i>etiquette</i>
      and <i>bienséance</i>. Being, therefore, at that moment in the act of
      revolving in his anxious mind a most weighty matter on which he required
      good advice, Charley was the man of all others he most wished to meet
      with. Marching vigorously onward he soon reached the spot where,
      half-sitting, half-lying, on the broad top of a low stone balustrade,
      Leicester was ruminating over his cigar. Having halted immediately in
      front of his victim, De Grandeville raised his hand to his forehead in a
      military salute, which manouvre, acquired partly in jest, partly in
      earnest, had now become habitual to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;enjoying a weed? eh! Mr. Leicester?&rdquo; he began. &ldquo; &rsquo;Pon my
      word, you&rsquo;ve selected a most picturesque spot for your bivouac. If it&rsquo;s
      not against the standing orders to smoke here, I&rsquo;ll join you in a cigar,
      for&mdash;ar&mdash;to tell you the truth, I rather want five minutes&rsquo;
      conversation with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in for it,&rdquo; thought Leicester. &ldquo;Well, what must be, must; the sun
      will be off here in about half-an-hour, and I suppose I can endure him for
      that space of time.&rdquo; He only said, however, holding out his cigar-case
      languidly, &ldquo;Can I offer you one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;many thanks, you&rsquo;re one of the few men whose taste I can, rely
      on; but&mdash;ar&mdash;really, the things they sell now, and pretend to
      call genuine, are such trash, that&mdash;ar&mdash;I am forced to import my
      own. I sent out an agent to Cuba express&mdash;ar&mdash;at least,
      Robinson, who supplies my club&mdash;ar&mdash;the Caryatides, you know&mdash;sent
      him on a hint from me, and I can&rsquo;t match the cigars he brought me
      anywhere; I&rsquo;ve never met with anything like them. Ask your brother; he
      knows them&mdash;ar&mdash;I let him have half a box as the greatest
      favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell lives on cigars and gin-and-water when he&rsquo;s in his native state,&rdquo;
       returned Leicester, slightly altering his position so that he could rest
      his back more conveniently against a statue. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s been going too fast,
      and gets out of condition, he takes a course of that sort of thing, and it
      always brings him right again; it&rsquo;s like turning a screwy horse out to
      grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grandeville, who had appeared somewhat abstracted during this
      interesting record of the domestic habits of Lord Bellefield, changed the
      conversation by observing, &ldquo;Ar&mdash;you see, when a man of a certain&mdash;ar&mdash;position
      in society gets&mdash;ar&mdash;towards middle life&mdash;ar&mdash;say,
      three or four-and-thirty, it appears to me that it adds very much to his
      weight to&mdash;ar&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To drink brown stout instead of pale ale,&rdquo; exclaimed Leicester more
      eagerly than his wont. &ldquo;I observed you did so at&mdash;&mdash;, when we
      were treating the incorruptible electors, and it struck me as a decided
      mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes, I believe&mdash;that is, of course&mdash;you are right; but
      that was not exactly what I was going to observe,&rdquo; returned De
      Grandeville, slightly embarrassed. &ldquo;In fact, I was going to say that it
      adds to a man&rsquo;s weight in society, increases his influence, and improves
      his general position to be&mdash;ar&mdash;well married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that I scarcely know; it&rsquo;s not a matter to decide on hastily,&rdquo;
       returned Leicester, coolly lighting a fresh cigar, which, being of an
      obstinate disposition, required much scientific management and
      considerable hard puffing to induce it to perform properly. &ldquo;In regard to
      (puff) marriage, Mr. De Grandeville, looking at it philosophically&mdash;and
      I can assure you it&rsquo;s a subject on which I&rsquo;ve expended much (puff, puff)
      serious thought,&mdash;looking at it in a reasonable businesslike point of
      view, it becomes a mere (puff) affair of debtor and creditor,&mdash;a
      question of what you lose and what you gain. Let us try the matter by
      various tests and see how the account stands. We&rsquo;ll begin with the
      watchwords of the day, for instance: &lsquo;Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality.&rsquo;
      Liberty,&mdash;a single man can do as he likes without consulting anybody;
      a married man can do as he likes only when his wife shares the
      inclination, which, as no two people ever look at anything in exactly the
      same point of view, appears a somewhat stringent restriction. Fraternity,&mdash;a
      single man may choose his friends where he feels inclined, male or female,
      as it may have pleased Providence to create them; a married man dare not,
      unless he has a taste for domestic misery, and possesses eyes which are
      nail-proof, cultivate a female friendship, and somehow one feels if one
      were married one should not exactly wish to have a set of men always
      dangling about one&rsquo;s house. Equality,&mdash;a single man, if he has
      received a gentleman&rsquo;s education, wears a good coat, and has wit enough to
      keep himself warm, is anybody&rsquo;s equal; a married man must bear all his
      wife&rsquo;s burdens as well as his own, and doesn&rsquo;t get asked by the Browns
      because the Smiths have told them her great-grandfather was transported
      for stealing a pewter pot. Now, let us look at the per contra side. A
      single man soon gets tired of his unlimited Liberty; there&rsquo;s no fun in
      having your own way if you&rsquo;ve no one to contradict you. A little
      opposition becomes a positive luxury, and this you&rsquo;re sure to obtain <i>by</i>
      matrimony. Then, as to Fraternity, friends are better than acquaintances,
      certainly, just as a mule is preferable to a jackass, but they&rsquo;re not much
      comfort to one after all. My most intimate friend lives in Ceylon and
      writes to me once in five years about hunting elephants. Now, your wife is
      part of your goods and chattels, belongs to you as completely as your
      bootjack, and when in hours of indolence you wish to sit with your soul in
      slippers, she, if she is worth her salt, is ready to pull off the
      psychological boots that are pinching your mind, and prevent the <i>dolce
      far niente</i> from becoming meaningless and insipid. Lastly, there&rsquo;s no
      such Equality in the world as between husband and wife when they are
      really suited to each other, appreciate their relative positions justly,
      and endeavour to make practice and principle coincide. These are my ideas
      regarding the marriage state, Mr. De Grandeville; but &rsquo;tis no use
      discussing the matter. Society has long since decided the question in
      favour of wedlock, and there are only enough exceptions to prove the rule.
      Byron enunciated a great truth when he declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Man was not formed to live alone;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      the animal&rsquo;s gregarious, sir, and the solitary system is totally opposed
      to all its tastes and habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Charley emitted a long puff of smoke, and caressing his
      whiskers, calmly awaited his companion&rsquo;s reply; but this demands a fresh
      chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;RELATES HOW CHARLEY LEICESTER WAS FIRST &ldquo;SPRIGHTED BY
      A FOOL,&rdquo; THEN BESET BY AN AMAZON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;A</span>r&mdash;really&mdash;&lsquo;pon
      my word, you seem to have studied the subject deeply, Mr. Leicester,&rdquo;
       returned De Grandeville, who was somewhat astonished at the length and
      volubility of Charley&rsquo;s notable &ldquo;Essay on Matrimony,&rdquo; with which the last
      chapter was concluded, and too completely blinded by self-importance to
      perceive that the other was more or less laughing at him. &ldquo;However, the
      drift of your argument appears in favour of marriage, and&mdash;ar&mdash;in
      fact&mdash;ar&mdash;I quite think as you do on the matter. Now, in my
      position, I consider such an arrangement would be most desirable, always
      supposing one can meet with&mdash;ar&mdash;a suitable partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, there&rsquo;s the rub,&rdquo; rejoined Leicester, leisurely flipping the ashes
      from the end of his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider that I have a right to look&mdash;ar&mdash;high,&rdquo; continued De
      Grandeville, folding his arms with dignity. &ldquo;Our family dates from the
      Conquest; our Original ancestor came over as equerry to William of
      Normandy. I suppose you are aware how the name arose from an incident in
      that invasion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leicester professed his ignorance of the anecdote, and De Grandeville
      proceeded: &ldquo;My ancestor, who, like most of his descendants, was a
      remarkably long-sighted individual, was riding near the person of his
      liege lord some few days after the victory of Hastings, when at the
      extreme verge of the horizon he descried the city of Canterbury, and in
      the excitement of the moment he exclaimed, pointing with his mailed hand,
      &lsquo;<i>Voila! une grande ville.</i>&rsquo; William overheard the remark, and fixing
      his piercing glance upon him, observed sarcastically, &lsquo;Ha! sayest thou so?
      he who hath been the first to discern yon great city should be the first
      to enter it.&rsquo; &lsquo;By the grace of God, and with your permission, Sire, so I
      will,&rsquo; exclaimed my ancestor. William nodded assent, my ancestor clapped
      spurs to his horse, and never drew bridle till the standard of Normandy
      floated on the highest tower of Canterbury. For this gallant exploit he
      was made governor of the city, and received the name and titles of De
      Grandeville. It&rsquo;s&mdash;ar&mdash;a creditable story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extremely,&rdquo; returned Leicester, yawning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a vague idea the man we
      all came from was hanged for horse-stealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes&mdash;very good,&rdquo; rejoined De Grandeville, recognising an
      excellent jest in his companion&rsquo;s assertion; &ldquo;but, as I was about to
      observe, in my position a man owes as it were a duty to his family; he
      ought not to marry a nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly, such a connection should be avoided,&rdquo; returned Charley
      sententiously, presenting the hot end of his cigar to an inquisitive snail
      which appeared inclined to join the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;the De Grandevilles have been from time immemorial large landed
      proprietors,&rdquo; resumed their grandiloquent descendant; &ldquo;half the county of&mdash;&mdash;
      belongs to them; the estates held by my branch of the family are immense,
      and though&mdash;ar&mdash;just at present they are not exactly in my
      possession, yet if anything were to happen to my cousin Hildebrand and his
      seven boys, I might be placed in&mdash;ar&mdash;a very different position;
      therefore, in looking out for a wife, I hold it incumbent on me to select
      a lady who would not disgrace a prominent situation, were she called upon
      to fill one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leicester (whose attention had been thoroughly engrossed by the snail,
      which, after having made sundry futile attempts to avoid the cigar and
      continue its onward course, had at length yielded the point, and having
      turned round, was now crawling off in an opposite direction) somewhat
      astonished his companion by quoting with great <i>empressement</i> the
      words of the old nursery ballad&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      &ldquo;Off he set
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      With his opera hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As, however, he immediately afterwards assumed a look of the deepest
      attention, De Grandeville set it down as an instance of the eccentricity
      of genius, and continued&mdash;&ldquo;Ar&mdash;this, as you must perceive,
      renders certain qualifications essential in the object of my choice. I
      could select no one who by birth and position was not perfectly
      unexceptionable. I should also require her to possess, in an eminent
      degree, the manners of society; another great point would be&mdash;ar&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of tin,&rdquo; suggested Charley, making a face at the retreating snail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes&mdash;in my position it would of course be a matter of
      prudence, before bringing upon myself the expenses of a family, to
      ascertain that I can command an income sufficient to enable me to mix in
      the set to which&mdash;ar&mdash;in point of fact, I belong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing under £3000 a year would suit my book,&rdquo; replied Leicester, &ldquo;£3000
      per annum and perfection I might put up with, but £4000 would be better
      without an actual angel, and beyond that mark I&rsquo;d bate an attaching
      quality in the damsel for every additional £500 in the funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;I have reason to believe that the income of the lady in regard
      to whom I am about to ask your advice exceeds the sum you first
      mentioned,&rdquo; replied De Grandeville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is then a real <i>bona fide</i> lady in the case&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      positively marked down your bird?&rdquo; exclaimed Leicester. &ldquo;Pray, have I the
      honour of her acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes&mdash;I have often met her in your society&mdash;in fact,
      she forms one of the party now domesticated at Broadhurst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Staying in the house, eh?&rdquo; returned Charley, feeling slightly curious.
      &ldquo;By Jove! who can it be? you&rsquo;re not going to try and cut out Bellefield by
      proposing for my cousin Annie, are you? I wish you would, it would sell
      Bell so beautifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;ar&mdash;you are joking,&rdquo; returned De Grandeville
      proudly. &ldquo;I would not do such a shabby thing by his lordship upon any
      consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leicester was amused at the cool way in which his companion seemed to take
      it for granted that he had only to enter the lists against his brother in
      order to secure the prize. He kept his entertainment to himself, however,
      merely replying, &ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t Annie, who is it? I can scarcely
      imagine you have set your affections on Miss Livingstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Livingstones are a good old family,&rdquo; returned De Grandeville, &ldquo;but
      the representative of the name to whom you allude would have been a more
      suitable match for my late excellent father than for myself. No, sir, the
      lady to whom I may probably offer the opportunity of allying herself to
      the house of De Grandeville is as suitable in age as in all other
      qualifications&mdash;Miss Peyton is in her two-and-twentieth year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss how much!&rdquo; exclaimed Leicester impetuously, sitting bolt upright and
      flinging the remnant of his cigar after the snail, which was yet striving
      to make good its retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Laura Peyton,&rdquo; returned De Grandeville; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you are
      surprised. I am aware, as well as yourself, that her grandfather was in
      trade. I can assure you that stood in my way for a long time, and it was
      not till I had gone through the pedigree carefully, with a friend in the
      Herald&rsquo;s College, and clearly traced back the family to the time of
      Richard Cour de Lion, that I ever thought seriously of the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you mean to carry on the campaign?&rdquo; asked Leicester, who had
      by this time recovered his composure. &ldquo;Do you intend to lay regular siege
      to the young lady&rsquo;s affections, or is it to be a look-and-die, &lsquo;<i>veni
      vidi, vici</i>&rsquo; affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;really&mdash;I am scarcely sanguine enough to hope to carry the
      citadel by a <i>coup-de-maim</i>,&rdquo; returned De Grandeville; &ldquo;but my
      tactics will be very much regulated by those of my fair enemy at present.
      If I might judge by one or two slight skirmishes we have had together, the
      garrison will not hold out to extremity when once the breastworks are
      taken, and the place properly invested.&rdquo; At this moment a servant
      approached De Grandeville with a message from General Grant requesting his
      presence. &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes&mdash;say I&rsquo;ll attend the General immediately,&rdquo;
       was the reply; then, as the servant departed, De Grandville continued, &ldquo;Ar&mdash;the
      course of true love never did run smooth, you see, Mr. Leicester. Ar&mdash;I
      shall have an opportunity of speaking to you again on this matter, and
      hearing your opinion more in full; at present I must wish you good
      morning.&rdquo; So saying, he slightly raised his hat in salutation, and marched
      off in a great state of dignified self-complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester watched him till he was out of sight; then, springing from his
      seat, he began pacing up and down the terrace with hasty strides,
      muttering from time to time such uncomplimentary remarks as, &ldquo;Insufferable
      puppy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conceited ass!&rdquo; all of which evidently bore reference to his late
      companion. Having let off a little of his extra steam by this means, he
      gave vent to the following soliloquy: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m nicely in for it this
      time! Because a love affair, with the chance of possible consequences,
      wasn&rsquo;t trouble enough, I must have a rival step in&mdash;and such a rival&mdash;why,
      the very sight of that man disagrees with me; and then to hear him talk,
      it&rsquo;s positively sickening! I&rsquo;ll be off to London to-morrow morning; and
      yet I do like the girl,&mdash;I know I do, because it is continually
      occurring to me that I am not half good enough for her. I suppose she
      looks upon me as a mere fortune-hunter&mdash;thinks I only care about her
      for the sake of her money. I wish she hadn&rsquo;t a farthing! I wish&mdash;eh!
      what am I talking about? Heigho! that&rsquo;s another curse of poverty: a poor
      devil like me can&rsquo;t even afford the luxury of a disinterested attachment.
      Then that man&mdash;that De Grandeville&mdash;to hear an animal like that
      debating whether she was good enough for him! I declare he&rsquo;s made me feel
      quite feverish! I&rsquo;d no idea it was possible for <i>anything</i> to excite
      me to such a degree. If the notion were not too preposterous, I should
      really begin to fancy I must be falling in love! She never can have the
      bad taste to like him&mdash;in fact, there&rsquo;s nothing to like in him&mdash;and
      yet the fellow seemed confident; but that is the nature of the brute.
      Though I don&rsquo;t know, women are such fools sometimes, she might take him at
      his own price&mdash;that military swagger of his might go down with some
      of the sex. Once let a woman fancy a man to be a hero, or a martyr, or a
      patriot, or any other uncomfortable celebrity certain to make a bad
      husband, and she will be ready to throw herself at his head,&mdash;just as
      if such a fellow were not the very last man in the world whom she ought to
      select! I suppose it&rsquo;s the additional odds in favour of widowhood that
      constitute the great attraction&mdash;females are naturally capricious.
      Well, I shall try and take the matter easily, at all events. I dare say it
      won&rsquo;t break my heart whichever way it goes. I shall make observations, and
      if she really has the bad taste to prefer this man, he&rsquo;s welcome to her&mdash;a
      woman who could love him would never do for my wife; that one fact would
      argue an amount of incompatibility of temper which would be furnishing
      work for Doctors&rsquo; Commons before the first year&rsquo;s connubial infelicity was
      over. I wonder whether there&rsquo;s any lunch going on; it&rsquo;s astonishing how
      thirsty anything of this kind makes me! Pale ale I must have, or <i>mit
      colum!</i>&rdquo; And having arrived at this conclusion, he thrust his hands&mdash;of
      whose delicate appearance he was especially careful&mdash;into his pockets
      to preserve them from the cold, and strolled off to put his resolution
      into practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Marmaduke De Grandeville, while listening with his
      outward ears to General Grant&rsquo;s dull electioneering details, was inwardly
      congratulating himself on the favourable impression he had made on that
      very sensible young man, the Honourable Charles Leicester, and thinking
      what a useful ally he had secured to assist him in carrying out his
      matrimonial project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verily, there are as many comedies performed off the stage as upon it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball at Broadhurst took place on the evening of the day on which the
      above conversation had passed, and was a wonderful affair indeed. It was
      given for a special purpose, and that purpose was to conciliate everybody,
      and induce everybody to promise General Grant their vote and interest at
      the ensuing election. Accordingly, everybody was invited&mdash;at least
      everybody who had the slightest pretension to be anybody&mdash;and
      everybody came; and as almost everybody brought somebody else with them, a
      wife, or a daughter, or the young lady from London who was spending
      Christmas with them, there was no lack of guests. The object of the
      entertainment was no secret; and the king of the county, the Marquis of C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      being in the conservative interest, and consequently anxious to secure the
      General&rsquo;s return, not only came himself, but actually brought a real live
      duke with him to exhibit to the company. This was a great stroke of
      policy, and told immensely, particularly with the smaller anybodies who
      were almost nobodies, but who, having associated with a duke, straightway
      became somebodies, and remained so ever after. Moreover, in all cases of
      incipient radicalism, chartist tendencies, or socialist symptoms, his
      Grace was an infallible specific. Depend on it, there is no better remedy
      for a certain sort of democracy than a decoction of strawberry-leaves;
      apply that to the sore place and the patient instantly becomes sound in
      his opinions, and continues a healthy member of the body politic. The
      particular duke on the occasion in question was a very young one, little
      more than a boy in fact (if a duke can ever be considered in the light of
      a boy). This youthful nobleman had a leading idea&mdash;though you would
      hardly have supposed it, to look at him&mdash;he believed that he was the
      best match in England; and so, in the conventional sense of the term, he
      undoubtedly was, although he would have been very dear at the price to any
      woman with a head and a heart. His pastors and masters, backed by the
      maternal anxieties of a duchess unambitious of the dignities of
      dowagership, had sedulously cultivated this one idea till it had assumed
      the character of a monomania, under the influence of which this unhappy
      scion of aristocracy looked upon life as a state of perpetual warfare
      against the whole race of women, and was haunted by a frightful vision of
      himself carried off and forcibly married to the chief of a horde of female
      pirates, with long tongues, longer nails, and an utter absence of
      creditable ancestry. His outward duke (if we may be allowed the
      expression) was decidedly prepossessing. He was tall and not ungraceful in
      figure, and had a bright, round, innocent face, as of a good child. His
      hair was nicely brushed and parted; whiskers he had none; indeed, the
      stinginess of nature to him in this particular was so remarkable, that, as
      the eldest Miss Simpkins afterwards observed to an eager audience of
      uninvited younger sisters, &ldquo;So far from whiskers, my dears, now I come to
      think of it, his Grace had <i>rather the reverse!</i>&rdquo; However, take him
      &ldquo;for all in all,&rdquo; he was a very creditable young duke, and a perfect
      godsend on the occasion in question. Then there was a descending scale
      from his Grace downwards, leading through the aristocracy of birth to the
      aristocracy of riches, till it reached the <i>élite</i> of the country
      towns, and the more presentable specimens of yeomen farmers. But let us
      join a group of people that we know, and hear what they think of the
      guests who are so rapidly assembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a snug corner of the reception-room, not far from a door leading into
      the large drawing-room, stands one of those mysterious innovations of
      modern upholstery, a species of the genus ottoman, which resembles a
      Brobdignagian mushroom, with a thimble made to match stuck in the middle
      of it. Seated at her ease upon this nondescript, half-buried by the
      yielding cushions, appeared the pretty figure of Laura Peyton; by her
      side, attired in much white muslin, crinolined to a balloon-like
      rotundity, but which apparently had shrunk abominably at the wash in the
      region round about its wearer&rsquo;s neck and shoulders, sat another&mdash;well,
      from the juvenility of her dress and manners we suppose we must say <i>young</i>
      lady, though it was a historical fact that she had been at school with
      Annie Grant&rsquo;s mother; but then poor Mrs. Grant married when she was quite
      a child, and died before she was thirty, and of course Miss Singleton must
      know her own age best, and she had declared herself eight-and-twenty for
      the last five years. This lady possessed one peculiarity&mdash;she always
      had a passion for somebody; whether the <i>object</i> was of the gentler
      or the sterner sex was all a matter of chance; but as she was in the habit
      of observing, &ldquo;there existed in her nature a necessity for passionately
      loving.&rdquo; and it has become proverbial that necessity has no law. The
      object of her adoration just at present was &ldquo;that darling girl,&rdquo; Laura
      Peyton; and really that young lady was in herself so lovable, that to
      endeavour to account for Miss Singleton&rsquo;s devotion by insinuating that the
      heiress was usually surrounded by all the most desirable young men in the
      room would be the height of ill-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Singleton, whose troublesome nature had another
      necessity for liking to hear its own voice as often as possible. &ldquo;Dear me!
      I wish I knew who all the people were! Dearest Miss Peyton, do not you
      sympathise? Ah, that tell-tale smile! We girls certainly are sadly
      curious, though I believe the men are just as bad, only they&rsquo;re too proud
      to own it. But really, we must contrive to catch somebody who will tell us
      who everybody is. There&rsquo;s that handsome, grave, clever Mr. Arundel: I
      shall make him a sign to come here&mdash;ah! he saw me directly&mdash;he
      <i>is</i> so clever. Mr. Arundel, do tell me, who <i>are</i> all these
      people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a comprehensive question,&rdquo; returned Lewis, smiling; &ldquo;moreover, you
      could scarcely have applied to any one less able to answer it, for beyond
      our immediate neighbours I really do not know a dozen people in the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arundel&rsquo;s acquaintance lies rather among illustrious foreigners,&rdquo;
       observed Miss Peyton demurely. &ldquo;Were any members of the royal family of
      Persia present, for instance, his intimate knowledge of the language,
      manners, and habits of that interesting nation would be invaluable to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are strong, be merciful,&rdquo; returned Lewis, in a tone of voice only
      to be heard by the young lady to whom he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! How very delightful! What a thing it is to be so clever!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Miss Singleton, arranging her bracelet and rounding her arm
      (which was now one of her best points) with an action that expressed, as
      plainly as words could have done, &ldquo;There, look at that&mdash;there&rsquo;s grace
      for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes some one who can tell us everything,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;that
      good-natured, fascinating Mr. Leicester, with his loves of whiskers all in
      dear little curls. Tiresome man! he won&rsquo;t look this way. Would you be so
      very good, Mr. Arundel, as to follow him and bring him here? Say that Miss
      Peyton and I want him particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you&rsquo;ll say nothing of the kind, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; interposed Laura
      quickly, with a very becoming blush. &ldquo;Really, Miss Singleton, you run on
      so that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will deliver your message verbatim, Miss Singleton,&rdquo; returned Lewis
      with the same demure tone and manner in which Miss Peyton had referred to
      the Persian prince; and without waiting to mark the effect of his words,
      he mingled with the crowd, and almost immediately returned with the
      gentleman in pursuit of whom he had been despatched. Charles Leicester,
      who was most elaborately got up for the occasion, though his good taste
      prevented him from running into any absurd extremes in dress, looked
      remarkably handsome, and being flattered by the summons he had just
      received, particularly happy. Both these facts Miss Peyton discovered at a
      glance, but whether urged by some secret consciousness, or annoyed by an
      indescribable look of intelligence which lurked in the corners of Lewis&rsquo;s
      dark eyes and revealed itself through the sternness of his compressed
      lips, she received him with marked coldness, and observed, in reply to his
      offer to play showman to the collection of strange animals there
      assembled, that she had no taste for zoology, and that it was Miss
      Singleton&rsquo;s curiosity he had been summoned to satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, Mr. Leicester,&rdquo; exclaimed that mature damsel, in no way
      daunted by a shade of discontent which, despite his endeavours to the
      contrary, overspread the countenance of the gentleman she was addressing;
      &ldquo;yes, indeed, I&rsquo;m dying to know all sorts of things. In the first place,
      who&rsquo;s that tall, stout gentleman in the wonderful waistcoat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Leicester, coolly examining the person indicated, &ldquo;that is&mdash;no,
      it isn&rsquo;t! Yes, surely!&mdash;I thought I was right&mdash;that is the
      Marquis of Carabbas.&rdquo; Then seeing from her manner she did not recognise
      the name, he continued, &ldquo;He has enormous estates situated in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Miss Singleton earnestly, thinking she had lost the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That interesting tract of country yclept, by John Parry, the Realms of
      Infantine Romance,&rdquo; continued Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Leicester, you&rsquo;re laughing at me. How wicked of you&mdash;the
      Marquis of Carabbas! Let me see: hadn&rsquo;t he something to do with
      Whittington and his Cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the cat, possibly,&rdquo; replied Leicester; &ldquo;for if my memory fail not,
      the fortunes of the noble Marquis, like those of the ever-to-be-lamented
      Lord Mayor of London town, were the result of feline sagacity, and it&rsquo;s
      not likely there existed two such talented cats&mdash;even Puss in Boots
      may only be another episode in the career of the same gifted individual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another of its nine lives, in fact,&rdquo; suggested Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; rejoined Leicester. &ldquo;I dare say it was the original &lsquo;cat
      of nine tales,&rsquo; only, like the sibylline leaves, several of the
      manuscripts have been lost to posterity through the carelessness of some
      elfin Master of the Rolls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but I really must interrupt you,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
      Singleton. &ldquo;Can you tell me, soberly and seriously, who that very
      strange-looking person may be who has just seized the General&rsquo;s hand and
      nearly shaken his arm out of the socket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Laura Peyton&rsquo;s eyes asked the same question, though her lips
      were silent, Leicester glanced in the direction indicated, and immediately
      replied, &ldquo;That energetic female rejoices in the name of Lady Mary&mdash;but
      is more commonly known among her intimates as <i>Jack</i>&mdash;Goodwood.
      In person she is what you behold her; in character, she presents a most
      unmitigated specimen of the <i>genus</i> Amazon; for the rest, she is a
      very good woman at heart, but my especial torment; she always calls me
      Charley, and her usual salutation is a slap on the back. She hunts,
      shoots, breaks in her own horses, has ridden a hurdle race, in which she
      came in a good second, and is reported to have dragooned her husband into
      popping the question by the threat of a sound horse-whipping. And now,
      Miss Singleton, you&rsquo;ll have an opportunity of judging for yourself, for
      she has caught sight of me, and is bearing down upon us in full sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but is she really a lady?&rdquo; inquired the astonished Miss Singleton,
      who, in her philosophy, had most assuredly never dreamt of such a
      possibility as Jack Goodwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is second daughter of Lord Oaks,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and Goodwood is one
      of <i>the</i> Goodwoods, and is worth some £8000 a year; but here she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the lady in question joined the group. Her age might be eight
      or nine-and-thirty; she was tall and decidedly handsome, though her
      features were too large; she had magnificent black eyes and very white
      teeth, which prevented the width of her mouth from interfering with her
      pretensions to beauty; her complexion was brilliant in the extreme, nature
      having bestowed on her a clear brown skin, which withstood the combined
      effects of exposure to sun and wind, and softened the high colour induced
      by the boisterous character of her ladyship&rsquo;s favourite pursuits. But if
      her personal gifts were striking, the style or costume she saw fit to
      adopt rendered her still more remarkable. As it will be necessary to
      describe her dress minutely in order to convey any idea of her appearance,
      we throw ourselves on the mercy of our lady readers, and beg them to
      pardon all errors of description, seeing that mantua-making is a science
      in which we have never graduated, and of which our knowledge is derived
      solely from oral traditions picked up during desultory conversations among
      our female friends, usually held (if our memory fail us not) on their way
      home from church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dress consisted, then, of a gown of exceedingly rich white silk, made
      half-high in the body and remarkably full in the skirt, over which she
      wore a polka of bright scarlet Cashmere lined and trimmed with white silk,
      and adorned with a double row of the hunt buttons. Her head was attired in
      a Spanish hat of black velvet, while a single white feather, secured by a
      valuable diamond clasp, was allowed to droop over the brim and mingle with
      the rich masses of her raven hair, which was picturesquely arranged in a
      complication of braids and ringlets. She leaned on the arm of a gentleman
      double her age, whose good-humoured heavy face afforded a marked contrast
      to the ever-varying expression that lit the animated features of her who
      was, in every sense of the word, his better half. Leicester&rsquo;s description
      had but slightly enhanced the vigour of her mode of salutation, for as she
      reached the spot where he stood she clapped him on the shoulder with a
      small, white-gloved hand, exclaiming in a deep but not unmusical voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Charley! run you to earth at last, you see. Where have you hidden
      yourself all this age? Now, Goody,&rdquo; she continued, turning to her husband,
      &ldquo;you may go. Charley Leicester will take care of me&mdash;don&rsquo;t lose your
      temper at whist, don&rsquo;t drink too much champagne, and mind you&rsquo;re
      forthcoming when I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a life to lead,&rdquo; returned her spouse, appealing to Leicester.
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such a tyrant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be off, Goody, and don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; was his lady-wife&rsquo;s rejoinder.

      &ldquo;How is it we never see you at the Manor-House now?&rdquo; began the master of
      that establishment in a hospitable tone of voice, but his lady cut him
      short in his speech by exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? because he found you such a bore he could not stand you any longer;
      nobody can except me, and even my powers of endurance are limited, so,&rdquo;
       she continued, taking him by the shoulders and turning him round, &ldquo;right
      about face&mdash;heads up&mdash;march. <i>Voilà</i>,&rdquo; she added, turning
      to Leicester, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s famously under command, isn&rsquo;t he, Charley? all my good
      breaking in&mdash;he was as obstinate as a mule before I married him,
      nobody could do anything with him. He&rsquo;s in splendid condition, too, for a
      man of sixty. I&rsquo;ll back him to walk, ride, hunt, shoot, or play at
      billiards with any man of his age and weight in the three kingdoms. I&rsquo;ve
      been obliged to dock his corn, though; there was seldom a day that he
      didn&rsquo;t finish his second bottle of port. He only drinks one now. But I
      say, Charley, about this election of Governor Grant&rsquo;s, how is he going the
      pace? You must tell me all about it; I&rsquo;ve been in Paris for the last two
      months, and I&rsquo;m quite in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, I take so little interest in the matter that I can
      scarcely enlighten you, Lady Mary,&rdquo; returned Leicester, glancing uneasily
      at Miss Peyton, who was talking with much apparent <i>empressement</i> to
      Miss Singleton, though her quick ears drank in every word spoken by the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that girl?&rdquo; resumed Lady Mary, lowering her voice a little (<i>very</i>
      little) as she perceived the direction of Leicester&rsquo;s glance. &ldquo;Miss
      Peyton, eh?&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;You shall introduce me; but first tell me
      who&rsquo;s that man by her side, like an old picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;tutor to poor young Desborough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too good for the work,&rdquo; returned Jack; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s too near thoroughbred
      to take to collar and keep his traces tight with such an uphill pull as
      that must be. I say, Charley,&rdquo; she continued in a half whisper, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      handsomer than you are. If you don&rsquo;t mind your play, he&rsquo;ll bowl you out
      and win with the favourite&mdash;there, it&rsquo;s no use getting up the steam
      or looking sulky with me,&rdquo; she added, as Leicester uttered an exclamation
      of annoyance. &ldquo;I can see it all with half an eye; you&rsquo;re as thoroughly
      what Goody calls &lsquo;spoony&rsquo; as a man need to be; but now, Charley, don&rsquo;t go
      putting your foot in it, you know: is it all right with the tin? that&rsquo;s
      the main question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me to dance, for pity&rsquo;s sake, and let me get out of that creature&rsquo;s
      way,&rdquo; murmured Laura Peyton to Lewis; &ldquo;I never had a taste for seeing
      monsters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis smiled and offered her his arm. At the same moment De Grandcville,
      gaudily ornate, marched up and requested the honour of Miss Peyton&rsquo;s hand
      for the set then forming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am engaged to Mr. Arundel for the next quadrille,&rdquo; returned Miss
      Peyton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the following one, then&mdash;ar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have much pleasure,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;In the meantime allow me to
      introduce you to my friend Miss Singleton, who is at present without a
      partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grandeville, charmed to have the opportunity of obliging Miss Peyton,
      acted on the hint, and the two couples hastened to take their places in
      the quadrille then forming. Leicester&rsquo;s volatile companion still continued
      chattering, heedless of his evident annoyance, until she had worried him
      into a state of mind bordering on distraction, when some fresh fancy
      seizing her, she fastened herself on to a new victim and left him to his
      meditations. These were by no means of an agreeable character; and after
      wandering listlessly through the suite of rooms and watching Laura Peyton,
      as during the intervals of the dance she talked and laughed gaily with De
      Grandeville (an occupation which did not tend greatly to raise Leicester&rsquo;s
      spirits or soothe his ruffled temper), he strolled into a card-room
      tenanted only by four elderly gentlemen immersed in a rubber of whist, and
      flinging himself on a vacant sofa in a remote corner of the apartment,
      gave himself up to gloomy retrospection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not remained there long when Lewis entered and glanced round as if
      in search of some one; then approaching Leicester, he began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not seen Walter lately, have you? Your amusing friend, Lady Mary
      Goodwood&rdquo; (&ldquo;confound the jade,&rdquo; muttered Leicester, <i>sotto voce</i>)
      &ldquo;introduced herself to me just now, and having captivated Walter by her
      bright smile and scarlet jacket, carried him off, to tease me, I believe,
      and I can&rsquo;t tell what she has done with him. But,&rdquo; he continued, for the
      first time observing his companion&rsquo;s dejected manner and appearance, &ldquo;is
      anything the matter; you&rsquo;re not ill, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was,&rdquo; was the unexpected reply; &ldquo;ill&mdash;dead&mdash;anything
      rather than the miserable fool I am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what has occurred?&rdquo; asked Lewis anxiously. &ldquo;Can I be of any use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s past mending,&rdquo; returned Leicester in an accent of deep
      dejection. He paused, then turning to Lewis he resumed almost fiercely:
      &ldquo;The tale is soon told, if you want to hear it. I met that girl&mdash;Laura
      Peyton, I mean&mdash;in town about a year ago; in fact&mdash;for my
      affairs are no secret&mdash;every fool knows that I am a beggar, or
      thereabouts. I was introduced to her because she was a great heiress, and
      dangled after her through the whole of a London season for the sake of her
      three per cents. Well, last autumn I met her again down in Scotland; we
      were staying together for three weeks in the same house. Of course we saw
      a good deal of each other, and I soon found I liked her better for herself
      than I had ever done for her money; but somehow, as soon as this feeling
      arose, I lost all nerve, and could not get on a bit. The idea of the
      meanness of marrying a woman for the sake of her fortune haunted me day
      and night, and the more I cared for her the less was I able to show it. My
      cousin Annie perceived what was going on, it seems, and without saying a
      word to me of her intention, struck up a friendship with Laura, and
      invited her here; and somehow&mdash;the thing&rsquo;s very absurd in a man like
      myself, who has seen everything and done everything, and found out what
      humbug it all is&mdash;but the fact of the matter is, that I&rsquo;m just as
      foolishly and romantically and deeply in love with that girl as any raw
      boy of seventeen could be; and I don&rsquo;t believe she cares one <i>sous</i>
      about me in return. She thinks, as she has a good right to do, that I am
      hunting her for her money, like the rest of them, I dare say; and&mdash;stop
      a minute,&rdquo; he continued, seeing Lewis was about to speak&mdash;&ldquo;you have
      not heard the worst yet: because all I&rsquo;ve told you was not enough, that
      conceited ass, De Grandeville, must needs come and consult me this morning
      as to whether Miss Peyton was worthy of being honoured with his hand,
      hinting pretty plainly that he did not anticipate much difficulty on the
      lady&rsquo;s part; and by Jove, from the way in which she is going on with him
      this evening, I believe that for once he wasn&rsquo;t lying: then that
      mad-headed Mary Goodwood coming and bothering with her confounded
      &lsquo;Charley&rsquo; this and &lsquo;Charley&rsquo; that, and her absurd plan of monopolising one&mdash;of
      course she means no harm; she has known me from a boy, and it&rsquo;s her way;
      besides, she really is attached to old Goodwood. But how is Laura Peyton
      to know all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, rouse up, and go and tell her yourself, to be sure,&rdquo; replied Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not I!&rdquo; returned Leicester moodily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no more trouble about
      it. I&rsquo;ll leave this house to-morrow morning, and be off to Baden, or
      Naples, or Timbuctoo, or some place where there are no women, if such a
      Paradise exists&mdash;and she may marry De Grandeville, or whom she
      pleases, for me. You see, it would be different if she cared at all for
      me, but to worry one&rsquo;s heart out about a girl who does not even like one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Halte là!</i>&rdquo; interrupted Lewis; &ldquo;lookers-on see most of the game;
      and if I know anything of woman&rsquo;s nature&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and bit his lip
      as the recollection of Gretchen crossed his mind&mdash;&ldquo;depend upon it,
      Miss Peyton is not as indifferent to you as you imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see how coldly she received me to-night?&rdquo; urged Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and her so doing only confirmed my previous opinion. That chattering
      Miss Singleton had annoyed her by bidding me summon you in Miss Peyton&rsquo;s
      name; but the very fact of her annoyance showed consciousness; had she
      been indifferent to you she would not have cared. Then her irritation at
      Lady Mary&rsquo;s familiarity proves the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really think so?&rdquo; returned Leicester, brightening up. &ldquo;My dear
      fellow, you&rsquo;ve quite put new life into me. It&rsquo;s very odd now, I never saw
      it in that light before. What would you have me do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, as you say, you really and truly love her,&rdquo; returned Lewis gravely,
      &ldquo;lay aside&mdash;excuse my plain speaking&mdash;lay aside your fashionable
      airs, which disguise your true nature, and tell her of your affection in a
      simple, manly way, and if she is the girl I take her to be, your trouble
      will not be wasted.&rdquo; So saying, he rose and quitted the room, leaving
      Leicester to reflect on his advice.

      CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;CONTAINS A MYSTERIOUS INCIDENT, AND SHOWS HOW THE
      COURSE OF TRUE LOVE NEVER DOES RUN SMOOTH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s Lewis, after the
      conversation detailed in the last chapter, was prosecuting his search for
      Walter through the various apartments he encountered Annie Grant, who,
      having escaped the vigilance of Miss Livingstone, was enjoying, in company
      with a young lady friend, the dangerous luxury of standing by an open
      window. The moment she perceived Lewis she advanced towards him and began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I detain you one moment, Mr. Arundel? Can you tell me anything of my
      cousin Charles? I&rsquo;m afraid he must be ill, and I wished him to exert
      himself so particularly to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not ill,&rdquo; returned Lewis. &ldquo;I left him not two minutes since in the
      card-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the card-room?&rdquo; repeated Annie in a tone of annoyance; &ldquo;what can he be
      doing there? Is he playing whist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;he did not appear in a humour to enjoy the dancing,
      and had gone there for the sake of quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fit of his incorrigible idleness, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked Annie pettishly;
      &ldquo;really it is too provoking; it must seem so odd his absenting himself on
      such an occasion as this. Would you mind the trouble of returning and
      telling him I want to speak to him particularly, and that he will find me
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be most happy; it is no trouble,&rdquo; began Lewis. He paused, and
      then added in a lower tone, &ldquo;Perhaps you scarcely do Mr. Leicester justice
      in attributing his absence to a fit of indolence; I fancied, from his
      manner, something had occurred to annoy him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something to annoy him!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie, starting and turning pale as a
      disagreeable possibility suddenly occurred to her. &ldquo;Surely he has not?&mdash;she
      never can have&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; then seeing Lewis&rsquo;s glance fixed on her
      with a look of peculiar intelligence, she paused abruptly, and a most
      becoming blush overspread her features. Lewis pitied her confusion, and
      hastened to relieve it by observing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have ventured to guess the direction of your thoughts somewhat too
      boldly, Miss Grant, you must pardon me, and believe that did I not think I
      might thereby in some slight degree repay the kindness Mr. Leicester has
      invariably shown me, I would not have allowed you to perceive it. If,&rdquo; he
      added in a lower tone, &ldquo;you will permit me to advise you, I believe you
      could most effectually serve your cousin&rsquo;s interests by explaining to Miss
      Peyton, at your first opportunity, the nature of the friendship which
      exists between Lady Mary Goodwood and Mr. Leicester, mentioning at the
      same time the fact that they have known each other from childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the difficulty, is it?&rdquo; rejoined Annie. &ldquo;Oh! I can set that right
      in five minutes. Thank you very much, Mr. Arundel&mdash;how extremely kind
      you are; but,&rdquo; she added with an arch look, &ldquo;you are most alarmingly
      clever; I shall become quite afraid of you.&rdquo; Then turning to her
      companion, she added, &ldquo;Now, Lucy dear, you will catch your death of cold
      standing at that window. You will send Charles Leicester, then, Mr.
      Arundel.&rdquo; So saying, she linked her arm in that of her friend, and the two
      girls left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leicester&rsquo;s a lucky dog to have such a zealous advocate in that sweet
      cousin of his,&rdquo; thought Lewis as he retraced his steps towards the
      card-room. &ldquo;She is a great deal too good for that brute, Lord Bellefield;
      she had better have chosen Charles, if she must marry either brother,
      though he is scarcely her equal in mind or depth of character, and without
      that I don&rsquo;t believe married life can ever progress as it should do.&rdquo; On
      reaching the card-room he found it only tenanted by the whist players; and
      rightly imagining that his advice had so far restored Leicester&rsquo;s spirits
      as to induce him again to return to the ball-room, he resumed his search
      for Walter, and at length discovered him in the ice-room, where, under the
      auspices of a pretty, interesting looking girl, the daughter of one of the
      tenantry, called in on the occasion to assist the female servants, he was
      regaling himself with unlimited cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Lewis was gently insinuating the possibility of his having had
      enough, two or three men, amongst whom was Lord Bellefield, lounged into
      the room and began eating ices at a table opposite that at which Lewis and
      Walter were stationed. One of the party, who was unacquainted with Lewis,
      apparently struck by his appearance, addressed Lord Bellefield in an
      undertone, evidently inquiring who the young tutor might be; the answer,
      though spoken in a low voice, was (whether designedly or not we will not
      say) perfectly audible to the person to whom it related.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That? oh, some poor devil old Grant has picked up cheap as dry-nurse to
      his pet idiot; a kind of male <i>bonne</i>, as the French term it; a sort
      of upper servant, half valet, half tutor. You need not notice him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a degree of littleness in this speech which completely robbed it
      of its sting. It was such a mean attempt at an insult that Lewis saw it
      would be letting himself down even to feel angry about it; and merely
      allowing his lip to curl slightly with a contemptuous smile, he folded his
      arms and patiently awaited the conclusion of Walter&rsquo;s repast. After Lord
      Bellefield and his friends had devoured as many ices as seemed good to
      them, they prepared to leave the room, and just as they passed the spot
      where Lewis stood, Lord Bellefield, in drawing out his handkerchief,
      accidentally dropped a glove. Not perceiving his loss, he was still
      walking on, when Lewis, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, resolved to adhere to
      his determination of treating Lord Bellefield as he would any other man
      his superior in rank, and perhaps inwardly rejoiced at the opportunity of
      returning good for evil, or at least civility for insult, stooped and
      picked up the glove, then advancing a step or two, he presented it to its
      owner, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my interrupting your lordship, but you have dropped your glove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that the moment before Lewis had removed his own glove
      to render some assistance to Walter, and had not replaced it when he
      extended his hand to Lord Bellefield, who, without making any reply,
      signed to his French valet, then assisting in the champagne department,
      and when he approached, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tenez, Antoine!</i> Take the glove from this gentleman, and bring me a
      clean pair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The insolence of his look and the affected drawl in which he spoke
      rendered his meaning so unmistakable, that, after a slight attempt to
      repress the inclination, one of his companions burst into a laugh, while
      the other, who had sufficient good feeling to be disgusted at such an
      unprovoked insult, turned on his heel and walked away. Lewis stood for a
      moment as if stunned; then, flushing crimson, he actually quivered with
      suppressed anger; still it was evident that he was striving to master his
      passion, and apparently he was in great measure successful, for when he
      spoke it was in a low, calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your lordship, considering this glove
      polluted by the accident of my having touched it, will never wear it
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ya&mdash;as,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;you may very safely come to that conclusion
      without any fear of misinterpreting my intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; continued Lewis, in the same low, clear voice, though his
      eyes, which were fixed on Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s, actually glowed with the
      intensity of his emotion, &ldquo;I will crave your permission to retain it as a
      memorial of this evening. Your lordship will observe it is a <i>right hand</i>
      glove. I may, on some future occasion, have the pleasure of calling your
      attention to the care with which I have preserved the relic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he bowed coldly, and still holding the glove with a vice-like
      grasp, as though he feared to have it wrested from him, he turned away
      without waiting a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth does the fellow want with that glove?&rdquo; inquired Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s companion, who, not being a particularly intellectual young
      gentleman, had been greatly mystified by the whole proceeding. &ldquo;And what
      in the world is the matter with you?&rdquo; he added, observing for the first
      time that his friend was looking strangely pale and shuddering slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;come along&mdash;we&rsquo;re standing in a confounded draught, and
      I&rsquo;ve never rightly recovered that ague I picked up at Ancona,&rdquo; was the
      reply; and taking his companion&rsquo;s arm, Lord Bellefield hastily left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      So engrossed had Lewis been with his own share of the transaction that he
      had not observed the breathless interest with which the whole scene had
      been watched by the girl before alluded to. She now approached him under
      the excuse of offering some cakes, and, as he somewhat impatiently refused
      them, said in a hurried whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but what is it you intend to do with that glove?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surprised alike at the question and the quarter from whence it proceeded,
      Lewis looked at the girl more attentively than he had yet done. She was
      above the middle height, and of a singularly graceful figure; her features
      were characterised by a degree of refinement and intelligence not usually
      to be found amongst persons of her class; she was very pale, and though
      she endeavoured to repress all outward signs of emotion, he could perceive
      she was fearfully agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do with the glove!&rdquo; returned Lewis. &ldquo;What makes you ask such an odd
      question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot deceive me, sir,&rdquo; she replied in the same eager whisper. &ldquo;I
      witnessed all that passed between you and&mdash;that gentleman just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is it you fear?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are going to challenge him to fight a duel to-morrow morning&mdash;and&mdash;and
      perhaps mean to wear that glove on the hand you shoot him with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she uttered these last words a strange expression flitted across
      Lewis&rsquo;s face; it had passed, however, ere he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken. As long as I remain under this roof I shall avoid any
      collision with that gentleman. Nay, more; should he repeat his insult
      (though I scarcely think he will), I shall not attempt to resent it. So,&rdquo;
       he continued with a smile, &ldquo;as I am living here, I think he is tolerably
      safe from me. Stay,&rdquo; he added, as, after glancing anxiously at his
      features, as though she strove to read his very soul, she was about to
      turn away, satisfied that he was not attempting to deceive her, &ldquo;stay; do
      not mention what you have observed amongst the servants; and here is
      something to buy you some new ribbon for your cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not accept your money, sir,&rdquo; she replied somewhat haughtily; &ldquo;but
      your secret is safe with me as in the grave.&rdquo; Then taking Walter&rsquo;s plate,
      which was by this time empty, she crossed the room and mingled with the
      other servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was later in the evening; much dancing had been accomplished, many
      civil speeches and some rude ones made, mild flirtations began to assume a
      serious character, and one or two aggravated cases appeared likely to end
      in business. The hearts of match-making mammas beat high with hope,
      marriageable daughters were looking up, and eligible young men, apparently
      bent on becoming tremendous sacrifices, were evidently to be had cheap.
      The real live Duke was in unusually high spirits; he had hitherto been
      mercifully preserved from dangerous young ladies, and had passed a very
      pleasant evening. Lady Mary Goodwood, who was equal to a duke or any other
      emergency, had been introduced to him, and had taken upon herself the task
      of entertaining him; and his Grace, being slightly acquainted with Mr.
      Goodwood, and fortified by an unshakable faith in that gentleman&rsquo;s powers
      of longevity, had yielded himself unresistingly to the fascinations of the
      fair Amazon, and allowed himself to be amused with the most amiable
      condescension. Charles Leicester, in some degree reassured by his
      conversation with Lewis, returned to the dancing-room and secured Miss
      Peyton for a waltz; but his success did not tend greatly to improve his
      position, as the young lady continued strangely silent, or only opened her
      mouth to say cutting things. The last polka before supper she danced with
      De Grandeville; on that gentleman&rsquo;s arm she entered the room in which the
      repast was laid out, and he it was who, seated by her side during the
      meal, forestalled her every wish with most lover-like devotion. Lord
      Belle-field, after the <i>rencontre</i> with Lewis, had consoled himself
      by taking possession of Annie, whose side he never quitted for a moment,
      and who he thereby prevented from holding any private communication with
      her friend Miss Peyton, her acquaintance with the domestic economy of her
      uncle&rsquo;s family leading her to divine that his brother would be about the
      last person to whom Charles Leicester would wish his hopes and fears
      confided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that things thus continued steadily to &ldquo;improve for the worse,&rdquo; and
      that the tide which Shakespeare discovered in the affairs of men appeared
      to have set dead against him, the unfortunate &ldquo;Charley&rdquo; having, in a
      spirit of self-mortification, repudiated supper and rejected offers of
      champagne with the virulence of a red-hot teetotaller, betook himself to
      the solitude of the music-room in a state of mind bordering on
      distraction, which fever of the soul Lady Mary Goodwood had not tended to
      allay, by remarking, with a significant glance towards Miss Peyton and De
      Grandeville&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Charley, cast your eye up the course a minute; the heavyweight&rsquo;s
      making play with the favourite at a killing pace. I&rsquo;d bet long odds he
      pops and she says &lsquo;Done&rsquo; before the meeting&rsquo;s over; so if that don&rsquo;t suit
      your book, Charley, my boy, the sooner you hedge on the double event the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music-room at Broadhurst was a spacious apartment, with a coved
      ceiling and deep bay windows hung with rich crimson damask curtains, and
      containing ottomans of the same material in the recesses. On one of these
      Leicester flung himself, and half hidden by the voluminous folds of the
      drapery, sketched out a gloomy future, in which he depicted himself
      quarrelling with De Grandeville, shooting him in a consequent duel, and
      residing ever after in the least desirable part of the backwoods of
      America, a prey to remorse, without cigars, and cut off from kid gloves
      and pale ale in the flower of his youth. Occupied with these dreary
      thoughts, he scarcely noticed the entrance of various seceders from the
      supper-table; nor was it until the sound of the pianoforte aroused his
      attention that he perceived the room to be tenanted by some twenty or
      thirty people scattered in small coteries throughout the apartment. At the
      moment when he became alive to external impressions Miss Singleton was
      about to favour the company with a song, having secured a mild young man
      to turn over the music, who knew not life and believed in her to the
      fullest extent with a touching simplicity. Before this interesting
      performance could commence, however, sundry preliminary arrangements
      analogous to the nautical ceremony of &ldquo;clearing for action&rdquo; appeared
      indispensable. First, a necessity existed for taking off her gloves, which
      was not accomplished without much rounding of arms, display of rings, and
      rattling of bracelets, one of which, in particular, would catch in
      everything, and was so incorrigible that it was forced to be unclasped in
      disgrace and committed to the custody of the mild young man, who blushed
      at it and held it as if it were alive. Then Miss Singleton drew up her
      head, elongated her neck to a giraffe-like extent, raised her eyes,
      simpered, cast them down again, glanced out of their corners at the &ldquo;mild
      one&rdquo; till he trembled in his polished boots and jingled the wicked
      bracelet like a baby&rsquo;s rattle in the excess of his agitation, and finally
      commenced her song by an energetic appeal to her mother (who had been dead
      and buried for the last fifteen years) to &ldquo;wake her early&rdquo; on the ensuing
      first of May. Just as she was assuring the company that &ldquo;she had been wild
      and wayward, but she was not wayward now,&rdquo; a couple entered the room, and
      apparently wishing not to disturb the melody, seated themselves on a sofa
      in a retired corner which chanced to be nearly opposite to the recess of
      which Leicester had taken possession; thus, although the whole length of
      the music-room intervened, he could (himself unseen) catch occasional
      glimpses of this sofa as the ever-changing groups of loungers formed and
      dispersed themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupants of the seat were Miss Peyton and De Grandeville; and could
      Charles Leicester have overheard the following conversation the passive
      annoyance with which he observed the colloquy might have given place to a
      more active sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;really,&rdquo; remarked De Grandeville, &ldquo;that is a very&mdash;ar&mdash;touching,
      pathetic song&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murdered,&rdquo; observed Miss Peyton, quietly finishing his sentence for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;eh&mdash;yes, of course, I was going to&mdash;ar&mdash;that is,
      your exquisite taste has&mdash;ar&mdash;in fact&mdash;ar&mdash;beyond a
      doubt the woman is committing murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recollect, the &lsquo;woman,&rsquo; as you are pleased to call her, is my particular
      friend, Mr. De Grandeville,&rdquo; returned his companion with a slight degree
      of hauteur in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes, of course, that speaks volumes in her favour,&rdquo; was the
      rejoinder; &ldquo;and although it is not every one who is gifted with the&mdash;ar&mdash;talent
      of vocalisation, yet the estimable qualities which one seeks in the&mdash;ar&mdash;endearing
      relation of friendship may be found&mdash;ar&mdash;that is, may exist&mdash;ar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think of the champagne at supper?&rdquo; interrupted Miss Peyton
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really&mdash;ar&mdash;&rsquo;pon my word I did not particularly notice
      it! was&mdash;ar&mdash;so agreeably situated that I could not devote much
      attention to the&mdash;ar&mdash;commissariat department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely it was unusually strong,&rdquo; persisted Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;yes, of course you are right, it is no doubt owing to its
      agreeably exhilarating qualities that it is so universally popular with
      the fair sex. Were I&mdash;ar&mdash;so fortunate as to be&mdash;ar&mdash;a
      married man, I should always have champagne at my table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a temptation!&rdquo; returned Miss Peyton, smiling ironically. &ldquo;Your wife
      will be an enviable woman, if you mean to indulge her in such luxuries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It delights me to hear you say so,&rdquo; exclaimed De Grandeville eagerly. &ldquo;If
      such is your opinion, I am indeed a fortunate man. I had not intended,&rdquo; he
      continued in a lower tone, &ldquo;to speak to you at this early period of our
      acquaintance on the subject nearest to my heart, but the&mdash;ar&mdash;very
      flattering encouragement&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Peyton in a tone of indignant surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you have deigned to bestow upon me,&rdquo; continued De Grandeville, not
      heeding the interruption, &ldquo;leads me to unfold my intentions without
      further delay. I am now arrived at an age when, in the prime of life, and
      with judgment so matured that I consider I may safely act in obedience to
      its dictates without the risk of making any great mistake, it appears to
      me, and to those of my highly born and influential friends whom I have
      consulted on the subject, that I might greatly improve my general position
      in society by a judicious matrimonial alliance. Now, without being in the
      slightest degree actuated by&mdash;ar&mdash;anything approaching to a
      spirit of boasting, I may venture to say that in the selection of a
      partner for life I have a right to look&mdash;ar&mdash;high. My family may
      be traced back beyond the Norman conquest, and the immense estates in our
      possession&mdash;ar&mdash;my cousin Hildebrand holds them at present&mdash;but
      in the event of anything happening to his seven&mdash;ar&mdash;however, I
      need not now trouble you with such family details, suffice it to say that
      we are of ancient descent, enormous landed proprietors, and that my own
      position in society is by no means an unimportant one. Now, although I am
      aware that by birth you are scarcely&mdash;ar&mdash;that is&mdash;that the
      Peyton family cannot trace back their origin&mdash;ar&mdash;I have made up
      my mind to waive that point in consideration of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Peyton. &ldquo;Doubtless your mature judgment
      has led you to discover many, in fact so? <i>some thousands</i> of good
      and weighty reasons why you should overlook the humble origin of the poor
      Peytons; but there is one point which appears to have escaped even your
      sagacity, namely, whether this unworthy descendant of an ignoble family
      desires the honour of such an alliance as you propose. That you may no
      longer be in doubt on the subject, allow me to thank you for the sacrifice
      you propose to make in my favour, and most unequivocally to decline it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one could be in De Grandeville&rsquo;s company for ten minutes without
      perceiving that on the one subject of his own importance he was more or
      less mad; but with this exception he was a clear-headed, quick-sighted
      man, used to society and accustomed to deal with the world. Laura Peyton,
      in her indignation at the inflated style of the preamble of his discourse,
      had committed the indiscretion of refusing his hand before he had
      distinctly offered it. De Grande-ville perceived the mistake, and hastened
      to avail himself of it by replying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Miss Peyton, but you jump rather hastily to conclusions. Had
      you heard me to the end you might have learned that there were equally
      strong reasons why in my present position I dare not yield to the impulse
      of my feelings&mdash;for that I greatly admire and respect you I frankly
      own. Should these reasons disappear under a change of circumstances, I
      shall hope to have the honour of again addressing you on this subject with
      a more favourable result. In the meantime, to assure you that I entertain
      no unfriendly recollection of this interview, permit me the honour&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, ere she was aware of his intention, he raised her hand to his
      lips, bowed respectfully, and rising, quitted the apartment. Miss Peyton,
      equally surprised and provoked at the turn De Grande-ville had given to
      the conversation, remained for a minute or so pondering the matter, with
      her eyes fixed on the ground; as she raised them they encountered those of
      a gentleman who was passing down the room at the time. Charles Leicester
      (for he it was) returned her gaze haughtily, and as their eyes met a
      contemptuous smile curled his lip, and bowing coldly, he passed on without
      a word. Well might he despise her, for he had witnessed the parting
      salute, and not unnaturally deemed her the affianced bride of Marmaduke De
      Grandeville. Ere he retired for the night his servant had received orders
      to pack up his clothes and to procure post-horses by eight o&rsquo;clock on the
      following morning. Annie Grant, who, when the latest guests had departed,
      sought her friend Laura&rsquo;s dressing-room to explain to her the old
      friendship which had existed between her cousin Charles and Lady Mary
      Goodwood was equally surprised and distressed to find her communication
      received with a hysterical burst of tears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;SUNSHINE AFTER SHOWERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nnie Grant found
      her friend strangely uncommunicative on the subject of her fit of weeping;
      she declared that it was nothing&mdash;that she felt nervous and
      overtired, but that a good night&rsquo;s rest was all she required to set her to
      rights again; then kissing her affectionately, Laura, with much caressing,
      turned her out of the room. As sound sleep was the specific to which Miss
      Peyton trusted for the restoration of her health and spirits, it can
      scarcely be imagined that, after passing four restless hours in a vain
      attempt to obtain the desired boon, she should have felt particularly
      refreshed. Weary both in mind and body, she was aroused from a dreamy,
      half-sleeping, half-waking, but wholly uncomfortable state into which she
      had fallen by the sun shining brightly into her room. The beauty of the
      morning, though a thick hoar frost lay upon the ground, banished all
      further desire for sleep, and commencing her toilet, she resolved on a
      scheme which her acquaintance with the usual habits of the family led her
      to conceive feasible&mdash;namely, to possess herself of the third volume
      of a new novel in which she was considerably interested, and with that for
      a companion, to take a brisk walk in the clear morning air and return ere
      any of the party had made their appearance at the breakfast-table.
      Dressing hastily, she wrapped herself in a thick shawl and tripped lightly
      down the staircase, only encountering in her progress a drowsy housemaid,
      who stared at her with lack-lustre eyes, as though she took her for a
      ghost. Before she could carry her whole plan into execution, however, it
      was necessary that she should visit the library in order to procure the
      volume she wished to take with her. Opening the door quickly, she had
      proceeded half-way across the room ere she perceived it was not
      untenanted. As she paused, uncertain whether or not to proceed, Charles
      Leicester&mdash;for he it was who, acting on his resolution of the
      previous night, was writing a few lines to account for his abrupt
      departure&mdash;rose from the table at which he had been sitting and
      advanced towards her. He was attired for a journey, and his pale features
      and the dark circles under his eyes gave token of a sleepless night. There
      was a restless energy in his tone and manner, as he addressed her, totally
      opposed to his usual listless indifference; and no one could be in his
      company a moment without perceiving that (to use a common but forcible
      expression) something had come over him&mdash;that he was (at all events,
      for the present) a changed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an early riser, Miss Peyton,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did not expect to have
      an opportunity of wishing you good-bye in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware you intended leaving Broadhurst so soon,&rdquo; returned Laura,
      feeling, she scarcely knew why, exceedingly uncomfortable. &ldquo;Shall you
      return before the party breaks up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I shall go abroad directly, and endeavour to procure an attachéship
      to one of the embassies; the Turkish, I think: I&rsquo;ve never seen
      Constantinople.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ve formed this resolution somewhat abruptly,&rdquo; observed Miss
      Peyton. &ldquo;It was only yesterday you agreed to escort your cousin Annie and
      myself to ride over and sketch the ruins of Monkton Priory. I was thinking
      this morning, as soon as I saw the sunshine, what a charming canter we
      should have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be more sorry, Miss Peyton, to be forced to break so agreeable
      an engagement, did I not feel certain <i>you</i> will have no difficulty
      in supplying my place on the occasion,&rdquo; returned Leicester, laying a
      marked emphasis on the pronoun. &ldquo;I must now wish you good morning,&rdquo; he
      continued; then bowing coldly, he took up his hat and turned to leave the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Peyton allowed him to reach the door ere she could make up her mind
      what course to pursue; then colouring brightly, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Stay one
      moment, Mr. Leicester.&rdquo; As he paused, and closing the door, which he had
      partially opened, turned towards her, she continued, &ldquo;I will not affect to
      misunderstand your allusion, and although the subject is one on which I
      should not willingly have entered, I consider it due to myself not to
      suffer you to depart under a mistake, into which I should have thought you
      knew me too well to have fallen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistake!&rdquo; repeated Leicester eagerly. &ldquo;Is it possible that I can be
      mistaken? Are you not then engaged to Mr. De Grandeville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly am I not,&rdquo; returned Miss Peyton, &ldquo;nor, unless I very
      greatly alter my opinion of that gentleman, shall I ever be so. I did
      think Mr. Leicester would have given me credit for better taste than to
      have supposed such a thing possible, but I see I was mistaken; and now,&rdquo;
       she added, &ldquo;having found the book I came to seek, I must wish you good
      morning, and&mdash;a pleasant journey to Constantinople.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, Miss Peyton,&rdquo; exclaimed Leicester, for once really excited; &ldquo;you
      have said too much or too little. Pardon me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I will not
      detain you five minutes, but speak I must.&rdquo; Taking her hand, he led her to
      a seat, and resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am placed in a position equally painful and difficult, but the best and
      most straightforward course I can pursue will be to tell you in as few
      words as possible the simple truth, and then leave you to decide upon my
      fate. The difficulty! have to encounter is this:&mdash;You are an heiress;
      I, a portionless younger brother, without a profession, and brought up in
      expensive and indolent habits. Were I then to tell you that I love you,
      and that the dearest wish of my heart is to call you mine, how can I
      expect you to think that I am not actuated by mercenary motives? to
      believe that I do indeed, deeply, truly love you, with an intensity of
      which I scarcely could have believed my nature capable? When first I
      sought your society, I frankly own (and if the admission ruins my cause I
      cannot help it, for I will not attempt to deceive you) it was the report
      of your riches which attracted me. I considered you lady-like and
      agreeable, and this being the case, I would willingly have done as I saw
      men of my acquaintance do everyday&mdash;married for money; but as I
      became intimate with you, and discovered the priceless treasures of your
      heart and mind, my views and feelings altered. I soon learned to love you
      for yourself alone, and then for the first time, when I perceived that in
      marrying you I had everything to gain and nothing to offer in return, I
      became fully aware of the meanness of the act I contemplated&mdash;in fact
      I saw the matter in its true light, and felt that to ask you to become my
      wife would be an insult rather than a compliment. Thus, the more I grew to
      love you, the less I ventured to show it, till at last, pride coming to my
      assistance, I resolved to tear myself away, and quitted Scotland abruptly,
      intending never to renew our intimacy, unless some unexpected stroke of
      fortune should enable me to do so on more equal terms. My cousin Annie,
      however, had it seems guessed my secret, and invited you here without
      mentioning her intention to me till you had actually arrived. Had I acted
      consistently, I should have left this place a fortnight ago; but I had
      suffered so much during my absence, and the delight of again associating
      with you was so overpowering, that I had not sufficient strength of will
      to carry out my determination; thus I continued day by day yielding myself
      to the fascination of your society, learning to love you more and more,
      and yet not daring to tell you so, because I felt the impossibility of
      proving&mdash;even now it seems absurd to say&mdash;my disinterestedness;
      but that I loved you for yourself alone. Such had been for some days my
      state of feeling, when yesterday I was nearly driven distracted by that
      man, De Grandeville, actually selecting me as his confidant, and
      consulting me of all people in the world as to the advisability of making
      you an offer of marriage, hinting that he had reason to believe such a
      proposal would be favourably received by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insolent!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Peyton, raising her eyes for the first time
      during Leicester&rsquo;s address, and looking him full in the face. &ldquo;So far from
      encouraging him, I have never spoken to him save to turn his pompous
      speeches into ridicule since I was first introduced to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I would fain have taught myself to believe yesterday,&rdquo; resumed
      Leicester; &ldquo;but the coldness of your manner towards me, and the marked
      attention you allowed him to pay you during the evening, tortured me with
      doubts, and when, after an animated conversation in the music-room, I saw
      him raise your hand to his lips, I imagined he had put his design into
      execution, and was an accepted suitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rejected one would have been nearer the mark,&rdquo; murmured Miss Peyton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Utterly miserable,&rdquo; continued Leicester, &ldquo;at the idea of having
      irrevocably lost you&mdash;provoked that you should have accepted a man so
      completely your inferior in mind, and, indeed, in every particular, I
      ordered post-horses before I retired for the night, and but for this
      accidental meeting should have been already on my road to London. And
      now,&rdquo; he continued with passionate eagerness, &ldquo;it is for you to decide
      whether my future life is to be happy or miserable. If truth has any power
      of revealing itself, you will believe that I love you deeply, tenderly,
      for yourself alone; and you will decide whether such an affection is
      calculated to ensure your happiness; but if you are unable to credit my
      sincerity, only say the word, and I leave you for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased, and clenching his hands in the excess of his emotion till the
      nails appeared to grow into the flesh, stood before her, pale and
      agitated, like a criminal awaiting the sentence which shall send him forth
      a free man or consign him to a felon&rsquo;s grave. After watching her anxiously
      for a few moments, during which she remained without speaking, her head
      averted and her features concealed by her close straw bonnet, he resumed:
      &ldquo;I see it is in vain to wait; your silence tells me that I have nothing to
      hope&mdash;fool that I was ever to deem it could be otherwise! Farewell,
      Laura; may you be as happy as I would have striven to render you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and his hand was again on the lock of the door, when a low,
      sweet voice, every accent of which thrilled through his very soul,
      murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Leicester&mdash;Charles&mdash;do not go&mdash;you will not leave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And accordingly he did <i>not</i> go, but came back instantly like an
      amiable, obedient young man as he was, and received the reward of merit by
      learning from the lips of her he loved that she was not only convinced of
      the sincerity of the affection he had bestowed on her, but prized the gift
      so highly that she felt obliged to return it, which statement sounded very
      like a contradiction, but was nothing of the kind. Then followed a bright,
      happy half-hour, one of those little bits of unmitigated sunshine which
      gleam once or twice in a lifetime to thaw the ice that tears which have
      never found vent form more or less thickly around the heart of each of us;
      and ere it was over, Laura Peyton stood pledged to become the wife of
      Charley Leicester, who dis-ordered the post-horses and postponed his
      journey to Constantinople <i>ad infinitum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several droll little scenes occurred later on that morning between various
      members of the party assembled at Broadhurst. In the first place, Annie
      Grant, who, completely tired out, and greatly concerned at the mysterious
      impediments which obstructed the course of her cousin Charles&rsquo;s love
      affair, had sought her pillow with a firm conviction she should never
      close her eyes all night, fell asleep immediately, and woke soon after
      nine o&rsquo;clock on the following morning under the impression that she had
      just gone to bed. While she was dressing she resolved in her anxious mind
      her cousin&rsquo;s difficulties, and came to the following conclusions: first,
      that for sundry reasons connected with his natural indolence and a painful
      sense of his dependent position, Charley would never &ldquo;tell his love;&rdquo;
       secondly, that Laura, not divining these reasons, was piqued and hurt at
      his prolonged silence; and thirdly, that it behoved her (Annie) to remove
      these stumbling-blocks by a little judicious interference. Accordingly,
      when she had finished her toilet, and, giving a last parting glance at her
      pretty face and graceful figure in the cheval glass in her dressing-room,
      had thought&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;ve any business to pry into
      her thoughts, but by the bright half-smile, half-blush which resulted from
      the inspection it may be concluded they were of an agreeable nature. When
      she had performed this little unconscious act of homage to her own beauty
      she tripped off to her friend&rsquo;s room, and found that young lady fastening
      a very dangerous little bow of ribbon around her neck, with a small
      turquoise brooch made in the shape of a true lover&rsquo;s knot. I wonder why
      she should have selected <i>it</i> from some twenty others on that morning
      in particular?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idle girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie, kissing her affectionately, as if idleness
      were a highly commendable quality, &ldquo;idle girl! not dressed at ten o&rsquo;clock,
      and I&rsquo;ve been ready for the last five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, dear; but if you knew what pleasant dreams I&rsquo;ve enjoyed,
      you would not wish to have dispelled them,&rdquo; returned Laura demurely,
      though there was a fund of merriment gleaming in her dark eyes which Annie
      in her innocence did not perceive. Feeling, however, that under the
      circumstances her friend had no business to have been so very happy, even
      in her dreams, she answered somewhat pettishly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been more favoured than I have been. I went to bed cross and
      worried, and fretted over all my troubles again in my dreams. Laura dear,&rdquo;
       she continued, &ldquo;I want to say something to you, if I thought you would not
      be angry with me: I wish you&mdash;but can&rsquo;t you guess what I&rsquo;m going to
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Peyton shook her pretty head, and confirmed the conviction expressed
      by De Grandeville, that her family was of modern date, by repudiating any
      connection with the race of Odipus. So poor, sensitive Annie was forced to
      clothe her meaning in plain and unmistakable words, which she endeavoured
      to do by resuming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin Charles, dear Laura&mdash;you know we were brought up together
      as children, and I love him as a brother; he is so kind-hearted and such a
      sweet temper; and of course I am aware he makes himself rather ridiculous
      sometimes with his indolence and affectation, but he has been so spoiled
      and flattered by the set he lives in&mdash;it is only manner&mdash;whenever
      he is really called upon to act, you have no notion what good sense and
      right feeling he displays. Dear Laura, I can&rsquo;t bear to see him so
      unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of this speech Miss Peyton coloured slightly; as it
      proceeded her eyes sparkled, and any one less occupied with their own
      feelings than was Annie Grant might have observed that tears glistened in
      them; but at its conclusion she observed in her usual quiet tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mr. Leicester is unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t know him as well as I do,&rdquo; returned Annie, her cheeks
      glowing and her eyes beaming with the interest she took in the subject;
      &ldquo;he was so wretched all yesterday evening; he ate no supper, and sat
      moping in corners, as unlike his natural, happy self as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear that he had ordered post-horses at eight o&rsquo;clock this
      morning?&rdquo; inquired Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! you don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie, clasping her hands in dismay.
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope he is not gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon it he is,&rdquo; rejoined Miss Peyton, turning to the glass
      avowedly to smooth her glossy hair, which did not in the slightest degree
      require that process, but in reality to hide a smile. &ldquo;He must be on his
      way to town by this time, <i>unless</i> anything has occurred this morning
      to cause him to alter his determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; returned Annie quickly; then adding in a tone of the
      deepest reproach, &ldquo;Oh, Laura! how could you be so cruel as to let him go?&rdquo;
       she burst into a flood of tears. And Laura, that heartless young hyæna of
      fashionable life, that savage specimen of the perfidious sex of whom a
      poet sings&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Woman, though so mild she seem,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Will take your heart and tantalise it;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Were it made of Portland stone,

      She&rsquo;d manage to Macadamise it&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      what do you suppose she did on the occasion? Nothing wonderful, and yet
      the best thing she could, for she wreathed her soft arms round Annie&rsquo;s
      neck, and kissing away her tears, whispered in a few simple touching words
      the secret of her happy love.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;BROTHERLY LOVE &ldquo;À LA MODE.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ow let us shake
      the kaleidoscope and take a peep at another combination of our <i>dramatis
      personæ</i> at this particular phase of their destinies. Lord Bellefield
      is breakfasting in his private sitting-room; a bright fire blazes on the
      hearth; close to it has been drawn a sofa, upon which, wrapped in a
      dressing-gown of rich brocaded silk, lounges the tenant of the apartment;
      a breakfast-table stands by the sofa, on which are placed an empty coffee
      cup, a small flask of French brandy, and a liqueur glass, together with a
      plate of toast apparently scarcely touched, a cut-glass saucer containing
      marmalade, and a cigar-case. His lordship appears to be by no means in an
      amiable frame of mind. He had sat up the previous night some two hours
      after the ball was over, playing <i>Ecarté</i> with certain intimates of
      his own, whom he had caused to be invited to Broadhurst, during which time
      he had contrived to lose between £200 and,£300. Earlier in the past day he
      had formed a canvassing engagement with General Grant for eleven o&rsquo;clock
      on the following morning, which had obliged him to rise sooner than was by
      any means agreeable to his tastes, or consonant with his usual habits; and
      lastly, he expected an important letter, and the post was late. While he
      was pondering this agglomerate (to choose a euphonious word) of small
      evils, the door opened noiselessly, and Antoine, the French valet,
      carrying a well-brushed coat as tenderly as if it had been a baby, stole
      on tiptoe across the room. Lord Bellefield, whose head was turned away
      from the door, stretched out his hand, exclaiming impatiently, &ldquo;Well,
      where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Milor!</i>&rdquo; returned the astonished Frenchman, who in his interest
      about the coat had forgotten the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters, fool, where are they?&rdquo; reiterated his lordship angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mille pardons, Milor</i>; but ven I did valk myself up zie stair, I am
      not avare dat zie lettairs had made zemselves to arrive,&rdquo; rejoined Antoine
      with a self-satisfied smile, as if he had said something clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ask?&rdquo; returned his master with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Non pas précisément</i>&mdash;I did not exactly demand,&rdquo; stammered
      Antoine with (this time) a deprecatory smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s only reply was an oath; then, seeing the man remained,
      uncertain what to do, he added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down again directly, idiot, and don&rsquo;t return without my letters,
      unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; a menacing gesture of his clenched fist supplied the
      blank, and the valet quitted the room, muttering with a shrug as he closed
      the door, &ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;ils sont barbares, ces Anglais</i>; but, <i>parbleu</i>,
      like all zie savage, dey are made of gold&mdash;<i>eh! bien, c&rsquo;est égal</i>,&mdash;he
      shall pay me veil for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield was not fated to enjoy the blessing of peace that morning,
      for scarcely had his servant closed the door ere some one else tapped at
      it. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; shouted the victimised peer, appending a wish concerning
      his visitor, of which the most charitable view we can take is that he was
      desirous of offering him a warm reception. However this may be, Charles
      Leicester (for he it was to whose lot his brother&rsquo;s left-handed
      benediction had fallen) entered the room, his face reflecting the joy of
      his heart, and drawing a chair to the opposite side of the fire-place,
      seated himself thereupon, and began rubbing his hands with a degree of
      energy totally opposed to his usual listless indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no other fire in the house that you are necessitated to come and
      warm your hands here, Mr. Leicester? I fancied you were aware that if
      there is one thing in the world which annoys me more than another, it is
      to be intruded on in a morning,&rdquo; observed his lordship pettishly. Then,
      for the first time catching sight of his brother&rsquo;s face, he continued,
      &ldquo;What on earth are you looking so absurdly happy about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t growl this morning, Belle; be a little bit like a brother for
      once in your life. I&rsquo;m come to receive your congratulations,&rdquo; returned
      Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your Jewish money-lender turned Christian and burned his books, like
      the magicians of old?&rdquo; inquired Bellefield sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something almost as wonderful,&rdquo; replied his brother, &ldquo;for I live in good
      hopes of paying him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say my father is going to be such a confounded
      fool as to pay your debts?&rdquo; continued Bellefield, springing up in the
      excitement of the moment. &ldquo;I swear I&rsquo;ll not allow it; he&rsquo;ll burden the
      estates so that when I come into the title I shall be a beggar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep yourself cool, my good brother; you might be sure I should never in
      my wildest moments dream of asking you to congratulate me on any good
      fortune which could by the most remote contingency either affect your
      interests or interfere with your ease and comfort,&rdquo; replied Leicester, for
      once provoked to say a cutting thing by his brother&rsquo;s intense selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Charles, I&rsquo;m in no humour for foolery or impertinence,&rdquo; said Lord
      Bellefield snappishly. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything you wish me to know, tell it
      at once; if not, I am expecting important letters, and should be glad to
      be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should you say if you heard I was going to be hanged, Belle?&rdquo; asked
      Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish you joy of your exalted destiny, and think things might have been
      worse,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apply both the wish and reflection to the present emergency,&rdquo; returned
      Leicester, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m in nearly as sad a case&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to be
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the principle that what is not enough to keep one can support two, I
      suppose!&rdquo; rejoined Lord Bellefield in a tone of the most bitter contempt.
      &ldquo;Well, I did <i>not</i> think&mdash;but I wash my hands of the affair
      entirely. Only mind this&mdash;the property is strictly entailed, my
      father can do nothing without my consent, and if you expect that you&rsquo;re to
      be supported in idleness at our expense&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I expect nothing of the kind,&rdquo; returned Charley,
      caressing his whiskers. &ldquo;My wife and I mean to set up a cigar divan, and
      all we shall look for from you is your custom; we certainly do hope to
      make a decent living out of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield uttered an exclamation expressive of disgust, and then
      inquired abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who is the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t exactly a woman,&rdquo; returned Charley meekly; &ldquo;that is, of course,
      speaking literally and in a physiological point of view she is a woman,
      but in the language of civilised society she is something more than a mere
      woman&mdash;for instance, by birth she is a lady. Nature has bestowed on
      her that somewhat unusual feminine attribute, a mind, to which art,
      through the medium of the various educational sciences, has added
      cultivation; then she has the sweetest, most lovable disposition&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! spare me your lovers&rsquo; raptures,&rdquo; returned Lord Bellefield; &ldquo;of all
      stale trash they are the most sickening; and tell me plainly, in five
      words, who she <i>is</i>, and what she <i>has</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura Peyton&mdash;heiress&mdash;value unknown,&rdquo; returned Leicester
      emphatically and concisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Peyton!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Bellefield in surprise. &ldquo;My dear Charles,&rdquo;
       he continued in a more cordial tone than he had yet used, &ldquo;do you really
      mean that you&rsquo;re engaged to Laura Peyton? Why, she is said to have between
      four and five thousand a year in the funds, besides a princely estate in&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shire.
      Are you in earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was so much so about anything before in my life,&rdquo; returned
      Leicester. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t marry Laura Peyton, and that very soon too, I shall
      do something so desperate that society had better shut up shop at once,
      for it&rsquo;s safe to be &lsquo;uprooted from its very foundations,&rsquo; as the
      conservative papers say if a poor devil of a chartist happens to strop his
      razor before committing the &lsquo;overt act&rsquo; by which he cuts his own throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word,&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Bellefield, as he became convinced
      that his brother was really in earnest, &ldquo; &rsquo;pon my word, you&rsquo;ve
      played your cards deucedly well. I declare, if I hadn&rsquo;t been booked for
      little Annie here, I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded marrying the girl myself. Why,
      Charley, you&rsquo;ll actually become a creditable member of society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a tap was heard at the door, and Antoine made his appearance,
      breathless with the haste in which he had run upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Enfin elles sont arrivées</i>,&rdquo; he exclaimed, handing the letters on a
      silver waiter; &ldquo;vhy for <i>zey vos si tard</i>, zie postman, he did slip
      up on von vot you call&mdash;(<i>ah! q té ils sont difficiles, ces sacrés
      mots Anglais</i>)&mdash;slid? <i>oui! oui!</i> he did slip himself up on
      von slid, and tumbled into two ditches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield seized the letters eagerly. Signing to the valet to leave
      the room, without heeding his lucid explanation of the delay, he selected
      one in a particular handwriting, and tearing it open, hastily perused the
      first few lines; then rubbing his hands, he exclaimed with an oath, &ldquo;By
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! Beppo&rsquo;s won, and I&rsquo;m a clear, £12,000 in pocket.
      Charley, boy,&rdquo; he continued, with a sudden impulse of generosity (for no
      one is all bad), &ldquo;how much are your debts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe about £2000 would cover them,&rdquo; returned Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll clear you, old fellow,&rdquo; replied Lord Bellefield, clapping him
      on the shoulder, &ldquo;and you shall marry your rich bride a free man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Bellefield, I can&rsquo;t allow it&mdash;you are too kind&mdash;I&mdash;I
      really don&rsquo;t know how to thank you&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s come to
      everybody this morning,&rdquo; cried poor Charley, as, fairly overpowered by his
      good fortune, he seized Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s hand and wrung it warmly. At
      that moment those two men, each warped and hardened differently, as their
      dispositions differed, by the world&rsquo;s evil influence, felt more as
      brothers should feel towards each other than they had done since they
      played together years ago as little children at their mother&rsquo;s knee. With
      one the kindly feeling thus revived was never again entirely forgotten;
      with the other&mdash;but we will not anticipate.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Pheasants,&rdquo; suggested Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to see him shoot pheasants,&rdquo; continued Walter, &ldquo;if you would let me
      go. Millar says,&rdquo; he added, seeing that Lewis appeared doubtful, &ldquo;Millar
      says all real gentlemen like shooting, and that I&rsquo;m quite old enough to
      learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One great change wrought in Walter since he had been under Lewis&rsquo;s
      direction&mdash;a change from which his tutor augured the most favourable
      results&mdash;was the almost total disappearance of those fits of morbid
      despondency and indifference to external objects, at times almost
      amounting to unconscious imbecility, to which he had formerly been
      subject; it was therefore a part of Lewis&rsquo;s system to encourage him to
      follow up vigorously any pursuit for which he evinced the slightest
      predilection; indeed, so effectual a means did he consider this of
      arousing his faculties, that he often sacrificed to it the daily routine
      of mechanical teaching. Having, therefore, run over in his mind the pros
      and cons, and decided that if he accompanied his pupil no danger could
      accrue, he graciously gave his consent, and having encased his feet in a
      stout pair of boots, and seen that Walter followed his example, both
      master and pupil hastened to the stable-yard to join the worthy individual
      with whom the expedition had originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millar, who, as the reader has probably ere this divined, was none other
      than General Grant&rsquo;s head gamekeeper, appeared anxious to be off without
      delay, as he had received orders to kill a certain amount of game which
      was required for a forthcoming dinner-party. The morning was, as we have
      already said, lovely, and Lewis enjoyed the brisk walk through some of the
      most wild and picturesque scenery the country afforded with a degree of
      zest at which he was himself surprised. The pheasants, however, not being
      endowed with such superornithological resignation as certain water-fowl,
      who, when required for culinary purposes were invited, as the nursery
      rhyme relates, to their own executions by the unalluring couplet,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Dilly dilly dilly ducks, come and be killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      appeared singularly unwilling to face death at that particular epoch, and
      contrived accordingly by some means or other to render themselves
      invisible. In vain did Millar try the choicest spinnies, in vain did he
      scramble through impassable hedges, where gaps there were none, rendering
      himself a very pin-cushion for thorns; in vain did he creep along what he
      was pleased to term dry ditches, till from the waist downwards he looked
      more like a geological specimen than a leather-gaitered and corduroyed
      Christian; still the obdurate pheasants refused to stand fire, either
      present or prospective (gun or kitchen), and at the end of three hours&rsquo;
      hard walking through the best preserves the disconsolate gamekeeper had
      only succeeded in bagging a brace. At length completely disheartened, he
      came to anchor on a stile, and produced a flask of spirits, with the
      contents of which (after fruitlessly pressing Lewis and Walter to partake
      thereof) he proceeded to regale himself. Finding himself the better for
      this prescription, he shouted to a dishevelled individual yclept the
      beater, who for the trifling consideration of eighteenpence per diem and a
      meal of broken victuals, delivered himself over to the agreeable certainty
      of being wet <i>to</i> the skin, and scratched and torn <i>through</i> it,
      with the by no means remote contingency of getting accidentally shot into
      the bargain. The creature who appeared in answer to this summons, and who
      in spite of the uncomfortable description we have given of his occupation,
      seemed to enjoy his day&rsquo;s sport excessively, was too old for a boy and too
      young for a man. His face was, of course, scratched and bleeding, and his
      elf locks, drenched with the hoar frost, now melted into a species of
      half-frozen gelatine, gave him a strange, unearthly appearance. His
      clothing, if rags which looked like the cast-off garments of an indigent
      scarecrow deserved the name, was so tattered and torn, that the fact of
      their hanging upon him at all was calculated to shake one&rsquo;s faith in the
      Newtonian theory of gravitation, till one gained a clue to the mystery by
      recollecting the antagonistic principle &ldquo;attraction of cohesion;&rdquo; the only
      personal attraction, by the way (save a pair of clear grey eyes giving a
      shrewd expression to his face), that our friend possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villiam,&rdquo; began his superior&mdash;and here let it be remarked
      parenthetically that it was the custom of this excellent gamekeeper
      invariably to address his satellite for the time being as &ldquo;Villiam,&rdquo;
       utterly disregarding the occasional fact that the sponsors of the youth
      had seen fit to call him otherwise&mdash;&ldquo;Villiam,&rdquo; observed Mr. Millar,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re vet.&rdquo; This being an incontrovertible certainty, evident to the
      meanest capacity, &ldquo;Villiam&rdquo; did not feel called upon to reply in words,
      merely shaking himself like a Newfoundland dog for the benefit of the
      bystanders, and glancing wistfully at the flask. &ldquo;Yer vet right thro&rsquo; yer,
      Villiam,&rdquo; resumed his employer dogmatically; &ldquo;so shove a drop o&rsquo; this here
      down yer throat, and make spurrits and vater of yerself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this proposition &ldquo;Villiam&rdquo; replied by stretching out his hand, grasping
      the flask eagerly, then tugging at a tangled lock of hair on his forehead
      as a salutation to the assembled company, and growling out in a hoarse,
      damp voice, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s wushin&rsquo; hall yer &rsquo;ealths,&rdquo; he proceeded to &ldquo;do
      his spiriting,&rdquo; though by no means as &ldquo;gently&rdquo; as the delicate Ariel was
      accustomed to perform that operation. Having thus qualified his cold-water
      system by the introduction of alcohol, the spirit moved him and he spake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer ain&rsquo;t bagged much game, Master, this mornin&rsquo;, I reckon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;no man can&rsquo;t shoot things as ain&rsquo;t wisibul, yer
      know, Villiam. I can&rsquo;t think vot&rsquo;s got all the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do tell I as pheasands as looks wery like ourn goes to Lunnun in
      t&rsquo;carrier&rsquo;s cart twice a veek,&rdquo; observed &ldquo;Villiam&rdquo; in a dreamy, absent
      kind of manner, as if the remark were totally foreign to the subject under
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s vot yer hear, is it, Villiam?&rdquo; returned Millar carelessly.
      &ldquo;Hif that&rsquo;s the case, I suppose (for &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t likely they valks
      there of themselves) somebody must take &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right, Master,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it hever cum across yer&mdash;take another drop of spurrits, Villiam;
      yer vet&mdash;has it hever cum across yer who that somebody his?&rdquo; demanded
      Millar in an easy, careless tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His it true as ther General thinks o&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; hon a second
      hunder-keeper?&rdquo; rejoined &ldquo;Villiam,&rdquo; replying, like an Irish echo, by
      another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi&rsquo;m avake, Villiam,&rdquo; returned his patron with an encouraging wink, &ldquo;it
      certingly his possibul hif I vas to tell ther General that I knowed a
      quick, hintelligent lad has might be wery useful in <i>catchin poarchers</i>&mdash;yer
      understand, Villiam&mdash;sich a thing might cum about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case hi&rsquo;m free to mention that hi see three coves a cummin&rsquo; hout
      o&rsquo; Todshole Spinney vith a sack as vosn&rsquo;t haltogither hempty, atween three
      and four o&rsquo;clock this here blessed mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And vot might yer be a&rsquo; doin&rsquo; yerself, hout o&rsquo; bed at that time o&rsquo; night,
      Villiam?&rdquo; inquired Millar suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lying in a dry ditch vith my heyes open,&rdquo; returned the imp
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sees!&rdquo; rejoined the keeper reflectively. &ldquo;Yer didn&rsquo;t happen
      haccidentally to know any o&rsquo; they three coves, Villiam, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ther von has carried the sack worn&rsquo;t haltogither unlike long Hardy, the
      blacksmith,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Mr. Millar meditated for some minutes in silence on the
      information thus acquired; then rousing himself with a sudden start, he
      observed, &ldquo;Now, Villiam, hif you&rsquo;ll be so hobliging has to beat along that
      ere &rsquo;edgerow to the right, ve&rsquo;ll see hif ve can knock hover another
      brace o&rsquo; longtails, and ve can talk about Mr. Hardy ven ve have finished
      our day&rsquo;s vork. There&rsquo;s a precious young limb o&rsquo; vickedness,&rdquo; he added,
      turning to Lewis as the boy got out of earshot, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s von hof &rsquo;em,
      bless yer, only he&rsquo;s turned again &rsquo;em with a mercenary view hof
      getting a hunder-keeper&rsquo;s sitivation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which rascality do you mean to allow him to succeed?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by no manner o&rsquo; means&mdash;halways supposing I can pump him dry
      without,&rdquo; was the prudent reply; and shouldering his doublebarrel the
      gamekeeper quitted his perch on the stile and resumed his shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the intelligence he had received had affected his nervous system
      (reserving for future discussion the more doubtful question of his
      possessing such an aristocratic organisation), or whether in the
      excitement of the moment he had allowed himself to imbibe an unusually
      liberal allowance of the contents of the spirit-flask, we do not pretend
      to decide; but certain it is that he missed consecutively two as fair
      shots as ever presented themselves to the gun of a sportsman, and ended by
      wounding, without bringing down, a young hen pheasant, despite the warning
      cry of &ldquo;&lsquo;ware hen&rdquo; from the perfidious &ldquo;Villiam,&rdquo; then located in a
      quagmire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, I never did!&rdquo; exclaimed the unfortunate perpetrator of this the
      greatest crime which in a gamekeeper&rsquo;s opinion a sportsman can commit; &ldquo;I
      &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t done sich a think has that since I wos a boy o&rsquo; thirteen
      year old, and father quilted me with the dog-whip for it, and sarve me
      right, too. This here&rsquo;s a werry snipey bit, too,&rdquo; he continued dejectedly;
      &ldquo;but hif I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;it apheasand, hit&rsquo;s useless to &rsquo;old up my
      gun hat a snipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ill luck in the morning has made you impatient and spoiled your
      shooting,&rdquo; observed Lewis, wishing good-naturedly to propitiate his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech, however, seemed to produce just a contrary effect, for Millar
      answered gruffly, &ldquo;Perhaps, Mister, you fancies as you can do better
      yourself; hif so, you&rsquo;re velcome to take the gun and try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection,&rdquo; replied Lewis, smiling at the very evident contempt
      in which, as a &ldquo;Lunnuner,&rdquo; his companion held him; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try a shot or
      two, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, then, sir,&rdquo; was the reply, as the keeper handed him the
      gun; &ldquo;the right barrel&rsquo;s shotted for pheasands, and the left for snipes;
      so look hout, and if yer don&rsquo;t bag Villiam, or Master Valter here, hit&rsquo;ll
      be a mercy, I expects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the unfortunate Millar hoped to console himself for his own failure by
      witnessing a similar <i>mis</i>hap on the part of the young tutor, he was
      once more doomed to be disappointed; for scarcely had Lewis taken
      possession of the gun when a splendid cock-pheasant rose within distance,
      though farther off than either of the shots the keeper had just missed,
      and, ere its gaudy plumage had well caught the rays of the sun above the
      tops of the young plantation, fell to the ground, quivering in the agonies
      of death. As the smoke from the discharge cleared away, a snipe, scared
      alike by the report of the gun and the approach of the beater, sprang from
      a thick clump of alder bushes and darted away, uttering its peculiar cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use&mdash;hit&rsquo;s clean out o&rsquo; shot,&rdquo; exclaimed Millar, as Lewis, swift
      as thought, again raised the gun to his shoulder. Slightly piqued by the
      keeper&rsquo;s contemptuous manner, he determined not to throw away a chance of
      vindicating his skill as a marksman, and though he felt by no means sure
      of success, on the &ldquo;nothing venture nothing have&rdquo; principle, the instant
      he got a clear sight of the bird he blazed away at it. Great then was his
      delight to perceive the snipe suddenly tower upwards and then drop to the
      ground, as if struck by lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vel, if that hain&rsquo;t a clever shot!&rdquo; ejaculated Millar, surprised into
      admiration in spite of himself; &ldquo;bless&rsquo;d if yer &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t tuk the
      shine hout of me properly. I thort yer vos a reg&rsquo;lar green un, but I&rsquo;m
      free to confess I couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave killed that ere bird at that
      distance ther best o&rsquo; times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor have I, it seems,&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, as the snipe, which was only
      wounded, rose, flew a short distance, and dropped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s dead this time. I&rsquo;ll bet a quart,&rdquo; observed Millar; &ldquo;hit&rsquo;ll never
      git hup no more, hif ve can honly find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; said Lewis; &ldquo;I marked the exact spot where it fell.
      Walter, do you stay with Millar till I come back. I should not like to
      lose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Lewis, completely carried away by the excitement of the sport,
      returned the gun to its owner, and dashing the branches aside, bounded
      forward, and was soon hidden amongst the trees, as he forced his way
      through the dense underwood towards the spot where he trusted to find the
      snipe. With some difficulty, and after much energetic scrambling, Lewis
      reached the place where he had seen the bird fall, but even then it was no
      such easy matter to find it, nor was it till he had nearly decided that he
      must relinquish the search that he discovered his victim caught in a
      forked branch, and perfectly dead. Having secured his prize, the next
      object was to rejoin his companions, and this accordingly he endeavoured
      to accomplish without delay; but since the days of pious Æneas the task of
      retracing our steps, the <i>revocare gradus</i>, has been a work of
      difficulty, more especially if we have begun by taking a few in a wrong
      direction, and Lewis&rsquo;s case proved no exception to the rule. After one or
      two wrong turns he became completely bewildered, and feeling sure that he
      should never discover his right course while surrounded by the thick
      underwood, he struck into the first path which presented itself, and
      following its windings, found himself, almost immediately, close to the
      hedge which separated that side of the plantation from a grass-field
      beyond. As he made his way towards a gap in this hedge his attention was
      attracted by the sound of voices, and on approaching the spot he perceived
      two persons engaged in earnest conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a man and a girl, the former, who wore the dress of a gentleman,
      having his arm round his companion&rsquo;s waist. The interview seemed, however,
      about to terminate, for as Lewis paused, uncertain whether or not to make
      himself known to the lovers (for such he conjectured them to be), the
      gentleman stooped, imprinted a kiss on the damsel&rsquo;s brow, then saying,
      &ldquo;Remember, you have promised!&rdquo; loosed the bridle of a horse which was
      fastened to the branch of a tree, sprang into the saddle, and rode hastily
      away. Not, however, before Lewis had recognised the features of Lord
      Bellefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise at this discovery was the first feeling of which Lewis was
      conscious, then a sudden desire seized him to ascertain who the girl could
      be, and without waiting to reflect on what further course it might be
      advisable for him to pursue, he crossed the gap, sprang over the ditch
      beyond, and presented himself before her. With a violent start and a
      slight scream at this sudden apparition, the girl raised her head,
      disclosing to Lewis the intelligent face and earnest eyes of the young
      female who had accosted him on the previous evening immediately after the
      affair of the glove had taken place. Lewis was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have startled you, I fear,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I quitted my companions to go in
      search of a snipe I had just shot, and becoming bewildered in the wood,
      have contrived to miss them. Hearing voices in this direction, I jumped
      over the hedge, hoping I should find some one who could tell me how to
      retrace my steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in the hazel walk when you left your party, sir?&rdquo; inquired the
      girl in a voice which faltered from various conflicting emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis answered in the affirmative, and she continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you go straight on till you come to the corner of the field you
      will see a gate on your left hand; get over that and follow the road which
      leads into the wood, and it will bring you to your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis thanked her, and then stood a moment, irresolute whether or not to
      allude to the parting he had just witnessed. It was no affair of his, and
      yet could he answer it to his conscience not to warn her against the
      designs which, he did not doubt, Lord Bellefield entertained against her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think me interfering without reason,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;but I was an
      involuntary witness to your parting with that gentleman, and I wish to ask
      you if you are acquainted with his name and position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl cast down her eyes, and after a pause, murmured that she knew he
      was very rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name?&rdquo; urged Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Leicester, brother to the young Lord,&rdquo; she believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has told you that, has he?&rdquo; returned Lewis sternly; &ldquo;and did it not
      occur to you to inquire of the servants last night whether your wealthy
      admirer had revealed to you his real name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she had never doubted that he had done so,&rdquo; making game of a fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps were unwilling to call attention to your connection with him
      by making the inquiry?&rdquo; resumed Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bright blush proved that he had hit upon the truth; but the probing
      nature of his questions roused the girl&rsquo;s spirit, and raising her eyes,
      she looked him full in the face as she in her turn inquired&mdash;&ldquo;And
      pray, sir, who are you? and what right have you to question me in this
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Lewis Arundel; I reside at Broadhurst, as tutor to Sir Walter
      Desborough,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and my right to ask you these questions is
      the right every man possesses to do his best to counteract the designs of
      a heartless libertine; for such I take your friend to be, and now I will
      give you my reasons for thinking him so. In the first place, he has not
      told you his true name: he is not Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s brother, as he
      pretends, but Lord Bellefield himself; and in the second place, at the
      very moment when he is making professions of affection here to you, he is
      engaged to be married to his cousin, the daughter of General Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true, you hate him,&rdquo; exclaimed the girl with flashing eyes.
      &ldquo;You quarrelled with him last night, and now you seek to revenge yourself
      by sowing dissension between him and me, but you shall not succeed. I see
      through your meanness, and despise you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girl, you are infatuated,&rdquo; returned Lewis angrily, &ldquo;and must reap the
      fruits of your obstinate folly. I spoke only for your good, and told you
      the simple truth. If you choose to disbelieve me, the sin will lie at your
      door, and not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he turned and left her. By the time he reached the gate into
      the wood his conscience began to reproach him for having been too hasty.
      He looked back to see if the girl were still there; she had not moved from
      the spot where he had quitted her, but stood motionless, apparently buried
      in the deepest thought. Suddenly observing that his eyes were directed
      towards her, she started, and drawing her shawl closer around her, hurried
      away in an opposite direction. Lewis watched her retreating figure till it
      became no longer visible; then getting over the gate, he walked leisurely
      along the turfed road to rejoin his companions. He was no coward, far from
      it; but had he known that at that moment a gun-barrel covered him,
      levelled by the stalwart arm and keen eye of one before whose unerring aim
      by the broad light of day, or beneath the cold rays of the moon, hare,
      pheasant, or partridge fell like leaves in autumn&mdash;one who, hiding
      from the gaze of men, had witnessed his parting from the girl not five
      minutes since,&mdash;had he known the deep interest felt for her by this
      person, and how, his suspicions being aroused, he had watched day after
      day to discover the features of her clandestine suitor, but had never
      succeeded, till, creeping through the bushes, he had accidentally come up
      at the moment when Lewis, having spoken eagerly to her, turned and left
      the spot,&mdash;had he known the struggle between the good and evil
      principle in that man&rsquo;s heart, a struggle on the result of which depended
      life or death,&mdash;had he known all this, Lewis Arundel, though a brave
      man, would scarcely have paced that greenwood alley with a pulse so calm,
      a brow so unruffled and serene.

      CHAPTER XXIX.&mdash;DE GRANDEVILLE MEETS HIS MATCH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>NPLEASANT as was
      the situation in which Lewis was left at the end of the last chapter, we
      can scarcely imagine that any of our readers, however they may be
      accustomed to look on the &ldquo;night side of nature,&rdquo; can have coolly made up
      their minds to the worst, and settled to their own dissatisfaction that he
      fell a victim to the poacher&rsquo;s gun. We say we cannot imagine such a
      possibility; not because we have any very deep reliance on the
      tender-heartedness of all our fellow-creatures, seeing that this tale may
      fall into the hands of a poor-law guardian or a political economist; that
      a butcher may read it fresh from the shambles, or a barrister after
      defending some confessed murderer. But we feel certain, butcher or
      barrister, law-giver or guardian must alike perceive that, as we are
      writing the life and adventures of Lewis Arundel, we cannot commit
      manslaughter without adding thereunto suicide; or, to speak plainly, we
      cannot kill Lewis without docking our own tale; therefore, the utmost
      extent for which our most truculent reader can possibly hope must be a
      severe gun-shot wound, entailing a lingering illness and a shattered
      constitution. But even these pleasant and reasonable expectations are
      doomed to meet with disappointment, the fact being that almost at the
      moment in which &ldquo;long Hardy&rdquo; (for he it was) levelled his gun at Lewis&rsquo;s
      retreating figure, his quick ear had caught a sound betokening the advance
      of some person through the bushes in his immediate vicinity; and neither
      wishing to encounter any of the gamekeeper&rsquo;s satellites, nor considering
      the deed he had meditated exactly calculated to be performed before any,
      even the most select audience, the poacher slowly recovered his gun and
      proceeded to convey himself away, after a singular snake-like fashion of
      his own, reserving to himself the right of shooting his supposed enemy at
      some more convenient season. In the meantime Lewis walked quietly on,
      unconscious of the danger he had escaped, until a turn in the road brought
      him in sight of his companions. During the course of their homeward walk
      Lewis questioned the gamekeeper as to his intentions concerning the
      poachers to whose proceedings he had that morning gained a clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, yer see, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; returned Millar, in whose estimation Lewis
      had risen fifty per cent, since his clever shot at the snipe, &ldquo;yer see, it
      ain&rsquo;t ther fust time as this chap Hardy has give us a good deal o&rsquo;
      trouble: we catched him a poarchin&rsquo; about three year ago, and he wor in
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; gaol for six months at a stretch.
      Veil, ven he cum out, he tuk to bad courses altogether&mdash;jined ther
      chartists, them chaps as preaches equalerty, &rsquo;cos, being at the
      wery bottom of ther ladder therselves, equalerty would pull them hup and
      their betters down; vunce let &rsquo;em get to ther middle round, and
      they&rsquo;d soon give up equalerty&mdash;hit would be the &lsquo;haristogracy of
      talent,&rsquo; or ther &lsquo;shu-premacy of physic-all force&rsquo; (vich means,
      adwisability of pitching into somebody else) vith &rsquo;em then. I hates
      such cant as I hates varmint, so I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered himself of this opinion with much emphasis, the keeper
      proceeded to relieve his mind by flogging an inoffensive dog for an
      imaginary offence ere he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, arter he jined the chartists he vent to Lunnun as a Delicate, as
      they calls &rsquo;em; and has they found him in wittles and drink,
      lodgin&rsquo; and hother parquisites, in course he worn&rsquo;t in no hurry to cum
      back; howsomdever, I suppose at last they diskivered what I could a told
      &rsquo;em at furst&mdash;that he wasn&rsquo;t worth his keep; and so they
      packed him off home agen. I &rsquo;spected vhen I heard he vas arrived
      vot he&rsquo;d be hup to. He calls hisself a blacksmith, but he drives more
      shots into &rsquo;ares and pheasands than nails into &rsquo;orses&rsquo; &rsquo;oofs,
      <i>you</i> may depend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you propose to put a stop to his depredations?&rdquo; inquired
      Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vy, I should like to catch him in the wery act&mdash;nab him vith the
      game upon him,&rdquo; returned the keeper meditatively; &ldquo;then ve could get him
      another six months. But he&rsquo;s precious sly, and uncommon swift of foot too,
      though he ain&rsquo;t fur hoff my age, vich shall never see five-and-forty no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, Millar,&rdquo; said Lewis, after a moment&rsquo;s consideration, &ldquo;I wish that
      whenever you receive information which you think likely to lead to this
      man&rsquo;s capture, you&rsquo;d send me word; there&rsquo;s nothing I should like better
      than to lend you a hand in taking him. I might be useful to you, for I am
      considered a fast runner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose it comes to blows? Them poarching chaps is rough customers to
      handle sometimes,&rdquo; rejoined Millar, with a cunning twinkle in his eye, as
      if he expected this information would alter his companion&rsquo;s intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the more exciting,&rdquo; returned Lewis eagerly; &ldquo;an affray with
      poachers would be a real treat after such a life of inaction as I&rsquo;ve been
      leading lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke&mdash;throwing off for a moment the cold reserve which had now
      become habitual to him&mdash;his eyes flashed, he drew himself up to his
      full height, and flung back his graceful head with an air of proud
      defiance. The gamekeeper regarded him fixedly, and mentally compared him
      with, not the fighting gladiator, for Millar&rsquo;s unclassical education had
      never rendered him acquainted with that illustrious statue, but he had
      once been present at a prize-fight, in which a tall, athletic youth,
      rejoicing in the ornithological sobriquet of &ldquo;the spicy Dabchick,&rdquo; proved
      victor, and to that dabchick did he assimilate Lewis. At length his
      thoughts found vent in the following ejaculation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, Mr. Arundel, hif ther&rsquo;s many more like you hup there, that blessed
      Lunnun can&rsquo;t be as bad a place as I thought it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis smiled. Perhaps (for, after all, he was human and under twenty-one)
      the evident admiration which had replaced the no less evident contempt
      with which the sturdy gamekeeper had regarded him earlier in their
      acquaintance was not without its charm; at all events, when, after another
      hour&rsquo;s shooting, Millar went home to dinner, and Lewis and Walter returned
      to Broadhurst, the young tutor diminished his income to the extent of
      half-a-crown, and the keeper, as he pocketed the &ldquo;tip,&rdquo; renewed his
      assurance that he would send Mr. Arundel timely notice &ldquo;vhenever there vas
      a chance of being down upon that poarching willain, Hardy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley Leicester, as he did not start for Constantinople, found himself
      at liberty to escort Laura Peyton and his cousin Annie to view the ruins
      of Monkton Priory, which in themselves were quite worth the trouble of a
      ride; had they, however, been even a less interesting combination of
      bricks and mortar than the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square (supposing
      such a thing possible), it would not have signified to the party who then
      visited them. Never were three individuals less inclined to be critical,
      or more thoroughly determined to be pleased with everything. The old grey
      ruins, frowning beneath the clear wintry sky, appeared the colour of
      strawberry ice to them; every object reflected the rose-tint of their
      happiness. As for Charley, a change had come o&rsquo;er him. The indolent,
      fastidious man of fashion, whose spotless gloves and irreproachable boots
      were the envy and admiration of Bond Street, had disappeared, and in his
      place arose an honest, genuine, light-hearted, agreeable, sensible being,
      to whom nothing seemed to come amiss, and who appeared endowed with a
      preternatural power of diffusing his own superabundant happiness amongst
      all who came in contact with him. The girth of his saddle broke; they had
      no groom with them. &ldquo;Grooms were such a bore, he would be groom,&rdquo; Charley
      had said; consequently there were no means at hand by which the injury
      could be repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind; he would get some string at the first cottage and tie
      it up; he was rather glad it had happened, riding without a girth was
      great fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Laura&rsquo;s horse stumbled, and Charley, forgetting his precarious seat,
      dashed in the spurs, intending to spring forward to her assistance. The
      horse <i>did</i> spring forward, but the saddle turned round. Mr.
      Leicester was, however, fated that day to fall on his legs, literally as
      well as metaphorically, and beyond being splashed up to his knees by
      alighting on a spot where the sun had thawed the ice into a puddle, he
      sustained no further injury. Laura was frightened; he must not mount again
      till he had been able to get the girth mended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned Charley; &ldquo;he would lead the horse then; it was
      pleasanter to walk than to ride such a cold day as that; he liked it
      particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he marched sturdily through mud and mire, leading his own horse and
      resting his hand on the mane of the animal ridden by Laura, for the space
      of some five miles, laughing and talking all the time so agreeably that
      the young lady came to the conclusion that she had never properly
      appreciated his powers of conversation till that moment. Altogether,
      despite the broken girth and the mud and the cold, to say nothing of a
      slight snowstorm which overtook them ere they reached home, each member of
      that little party felt mentally convinced that they had never before
      enjoyed a ride so much in all their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arundel, where are you?&rdquo; exclaimed Leicester, putting his head into the
      study as he passed the door on his way to his apartment. &ldquo;Can you spare me
      five minutes&rsquo; conversation?&rdquo; he continued, as Lewis, closing a book, rose
      to receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;pray come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wishing to see you all day,&rdquo; resumed Leicester, carefully
      shutting the door and glancing round the room. &ldquo;Where is your charge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is with the General,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He likes to have him for
      half-an-hour every day before he goes to dress; he talks to him, and tries
      to instil into his mind correct notions regarding things in general, and
      his own future social position in particular. Walter sits still and
      listens, but I&rsquo;m afraid he does not understand much about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No great loss either, I&rsquo;ve a notion,&rdquo; returned Charley irreverently. He
      paused, whistled a few bars of &ldquo;Son Geloso,&rdquo; entangled his spur in the
      hearthrug, extricated it with much difficulty, then turning abruptly to
      Lewis, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Arundel, I&rsquo;m no hand at making fine speeches, but
      recollect if ever you want a friend I owe you more than I can possibly
      repay you. Not that this is such a very uncommon relation for me to stand
      in towards people,&rdquo; he added with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned Lewis, &ldquo;you are reversing our positions: I am your debtor
      for my introduction to this family, and for an amount of kindness and
      consideration which you must be placed, like myself, in a dependent
      situation fully to appreciate. But,&rdquo; he added, glancing at his friend&rsquo;s
      happy face, &ldquo;I hope you have some good new&rsquo;s to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right in your conjecture,&rdquo; replied Leicester, &ldquo;but it is mainly
      owing to your straightforward and sensible advice that I have gained the
      prize I strove for. I was within an ace of losing it, though;&rdquo; and he then
      gave a hasty outline of his day&rsquo;s adventures, with which the reader has
      been already made acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis congratulated him warmly on his good fortune. &ldquo;You see I was right
      when I told you Miss Peyton was not so indifferent to you as you
      imagined,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that she liked you, not because you were a man of
      fashion, the admired of all admirers, but because she had sufficient
      penetration to discover that you were something more&mdash;that you
      possessed higher and better qualities, and were not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, my dear Arundel,&rdquo; urged Leicester as Lewis paused, &ldquo;go on. I like
      plain speaking when it comes from a friendly mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mere butterfly you strove to appear, I was going to say,&rdquo; resumed
      Lewis; &ldquo;but you will think me strangely impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; returned Leicester, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the truth; I can see it plainly
      now. I&rsquo;ve taken as much trouble to make myself appear a fool as other men
      do to gain a reputation for wisdom. Well, it&rsquo;s never too late to mend. I
      shall turn over a new leaf from this time forth, give up dress, restrict
      myself to one cigar a day, moderate my affection for pale ale, invest
      capital in worsted gloves and a cotton umbrella, and become a regular
      business character.&rdquo; He paused, and drawing a chair to the fire, seated
      himself, and stretching out his legs, subjected his boots, which bore
      unmistakable traces of his pedestrian episode, to the influence of the
      blazing wood. Having thus made himself comfortable, he fell into a fit of
      musing which lasted till, after gazing vacantly at his extended legs for
      some moments, his features suddenly assumed an eager expression, and he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Confound those blockheads, Schneider &amp; Shears: I suppose
      if I&rsquo;ve told them once I&rsquo;ve told them fifty times to give more room in the
      leg for riding-trousers. A horse&rsquo;s back is a wide thing, and of course
      when you stretch your legs across it you require the trousers to fit
      sufficiently loosely to accommodate themselves to the position; they need
      not set like a couple of hop sacks either; the thing&rsquo;s simple enough. I
      know if I&rsquo;d a pair of scissors I could cut them out myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glancing at Lewis as he spoke, Leicester perceived that he was struggling,
      not over successfully, to preserve his gravity, and the absurdity of the
      thing striking him for the first time, he indulged in a hearty laugh at
      his own expense ere he added, &ldquo;Heigh-ho! it&rsquo;s not so easy to get rid of
      old habits as one imagines. I see it will take me longer to unpuppyise
      myself than I was aware of. Seriously, however, I don&rsquo;t mean to continue a
      mere idler, living on my wife&rsquo;s fortune. My father has interest with
      Government, and I shall ask him to push it and obtain for me some
      creditable appointment or other. He will have no difficulty; the Hon.
      Charles Leicester, husband to the rich Miss Peyton, will possess much
      stronger claims upon his country than Charley Leicester the portionless
      younger son. In this age of humbug it is easy enough to get a thing if you
      don&rsquo;t care whether you have it or not; but if you chance to be some poor
      wretch, to whom the obtaining it is life or death, ten to one but you are
      done out of it. Poverty is the only unpardonable sin in these days; the
      worship of the golden calf is a species of idolatry to which Christians
      are prone as well as Jews. It&rsquo;s rare to find a sceptic as to that
      religion, even amongst the most inveterate unbelievers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, to whom Leicester in his self-engrossment had not perceived that
      his remarks would apply, bit his lip and coloured; then wishing to save
      his companion the mortification of discovering that he had accidentally
      wounded his feelings, he hastened to change the conversation by observing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will the magnanimous Marmaduke bear the news of your success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! to be sure, I was going to tell you about him when something put it
      out of my head,&rdquo; returned Leicester. &ldquo;The great De Grandeville was greater
      than ever on the subject&mdash;it was such fun. He came up to me after
      breakfast this morning, and catching hold of my button, began: &lsquo;Ar&mdash;Mr.
      Leicester&mdash;excuse&mdash;ar&mdash;won&rsquo;t detain you five minutes, but&mdash;ar&mdash;you
      see in regard to&mdash;ar&mdash;the matter we conversed on yesterday, when
      you were good enough to give me the benefit of your opinion concerning a
      certain proposed alliance, if I may call your attention once more to the
      subject; you will perceive that&mdash;ar&mdash;the affair has assumed a
      very different aspect&mdash;ar&mdash;indeed so completely different that I
      feel confident you will agree with me in considering the&mdash;ar&mdash;in
      fact the arrangement no longer desirable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him I was quite prepared to think as he did on this point, and
      begged to know in what the mysterious impediment consisted. &lsquo;Well, sir&mdash;ar&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t say it&mdash;ar&mdash;by way of a boast&mdash;ar&mdash;such things
      are quite out of my line, but you must have yourself perceived the very
      marked encouragement which my advances met with yesterday evening&mdash;ar&mdash;in
      fact the game was&mdash;ar&mdash;in my own hands!&rsquo; I succeeded in
      repressing a strong desire to kick him, and he continued with bland
      dignity: &lsquo;Ar&mdash;finding that this was the case, I felt that, as a man
      of honour, I was bound&mdash;ar&mdash;to make up my mind definitely as to
      my future course, and had&mdash;ar&mdash;all but resolved to acquaint the
      young lady with the brilliant, that is&mdash;ar&mdash;in many points
      unexceptionable position which awaited her, when fortunately&mdash;I might
      say providentially&mdash;it occurred to me to open a letter I had that
      evening received from my friend in the Herald&rsquo;s College. Imagine my horror
      to learn that her actual father, the immediately previous Peyton himself,
      had&mdash;ar&mdash;<i>horresco referais</i>, as Pliny has it&mdash; &rsquo;pon
      my word it quite upset me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This dreadful Papa, had he murdered somebody?&rsquo; inquired I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; was the answer; &lsquo;Lord Ferrers and other men with
      unexceptionable pedigrees have committed that crime. There is nothing
      necessarily vulgar about murder; the case was far worse. This intolerable
      proximate ancestor, who has not rested in his dishonoured grave above
      half-a-dozen years, was not only guilty of belonging to an intensely
      respectable firm in Liverpool, but had actually been insane enough to
      allow his name to be entered as sleeping partner in a large retail house
      on Ludgate Hill! Fancy a De Grandeville marrying the daughter of
      &lsquo;Plumpstern &amp; Peyton&rsquo;, dealers in cotton goods!&rdquo;&mdash;&rsquo;pon my
      word, sir, it took away my breath to think of the narrow escape I&rsquo;d had!&rsquo;
      &lsquo;And the young lady?&rsquo; inquired I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ar&mdash;of course it will be&mdash;ar&mdash;disappointment, as I&rsquo;ve no
      doubt she considered&mdash;ar&mdash;that she&rsquo;d made her book cleverly and
      stood to win, as the betting men say; but&mdash;ar&mdash;she soon had tact
      enough to perceive that the grapes were sour&mdash;ar&mdash;took that tone
      immediately,&mdash;clever girl, sir, very&mdash;ar&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder if she were to give out that she had discouraged my attentions&mdash;ar&mdash;in
      fact, virtually refused me&mdash;ar&mdash;I shall not contradict her, I
      owe her that&mdash;ar&mdash;with the exception of yourself, Mr. Leicester,
      her secret will be perfectly safe in my keeping.&rsquo; It was now my turn; so
      drawing myself up as stiffly as old Grant himself, I said, &lsquo;Confidence
      begets confidence, Mr. De Grandeville; so in return for your candour allow
      me to inform you that Miss Peyton, doubtless driven to despair by your
      desertion, has done me the honour to accept me as your substitute! One
      word more,&rsquo; I continued, as, completely taken aback, he flushed crimson
      and began stammering out apologetical ejaculations, &lsquo;I have listened in
      silence to your account of the transaction. I confess I have my own
      opinion about the matter, but should you adhere to your intention of
      preserving a strict secrecy in regard to the affair, I shall do so
      likewise; if not, I may feel called on to publish a somewhat different
      version of these love passages&mdash;one which will scarcely prove so
      agreeable to your self-esteem; unless, indeed,&rsquo; I added, seeing that he
      was about to bluster, &lsquo;you prefer settling the business in a shorter way;
      in which case I shall be quite at your service.&rsquo; So saying I raised my
      hat, bowed, and turning on my heel, left him to his meditations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which must have been of a singularly unsatisfactory nature, I should
      imagine,&rdquo; returned Lewis, laughing. &ldquo;But there is no chance of your
      fighting, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the slightest, I expect,&rdquo; replied Leicester. &ldquo;De Grandeville, to do
      him justice, is no coward, but he will have sense enough to see that he
      can gain no <i>éclât</i> by giving the affair publicity, and will remain
      quiet for his own sake. Luckily, I&rsquo;m not of a quarrelsome temperament, or
      I should have horse-whipped him, or at least tried at it, when he was
      talking about Laura.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a temptation which in your place I could not have resisted,&rdquo;
       rejoined Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s easy to be magnanimous when one is happy,&rdquo; returned Leicester;
      &ldquo;besides, I really was rather sorry for the poor devil, for, as I dare say
      you&rsquo;ve guessed long ago, it is clear Laura refused him last night&mdash;in
      fact she as good as told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it may benefit him,&rdquo; remarked Lewis. &ldquo;His vanity was too
      plethoric, and a little judicious lowering may conduce to the general
      health of his moral system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a case of too long standing,&rdquo; replied Leicester. &ldquo;Such a
      lamentable instance of egotism on the brain is not so easily to be cured;
      however, he&rsquo;s had a pretty strong dose this time, I must confess. And now,
      seeing that my boots have been wet through for the last three hours, the
      sooner I get rid of them the better.&rdquo; So saying, Charley Leicester took
      himself off, preparatory to performing the same operation on his
      perfidious boots.

      CHAPTER XXX.&mdash;THE GENERAL TAKES THE FIELD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he interview which
      Lewis had witnessed between Lord Bellefield and the girl dwelt in his
      thoughts, and was a source of much doubt and uneasiness to him. The quiet,
      secluded life he had led for the last year affording ample time for
      meditation&mdash;the almost total want of society (for poor Walter was no
      companion)&mdash;the peculiar position in which he was placed, shut out
      from all the pleasures and excitements natural to his age and taste&mdash;had
      given an unusually reflective turn to his vigorous mind, and produced in
      him a gravity and depth of character, to which, under different
      circumstances, he might never have attained. Thus, in the views he took of
      life, he was accustomed to look beyond the surface, and deeming it
      unworthy of a believer in the truths of Christianity to attribute events
      to the mere caprice of a blind destiny, was rather disposed to trace in
      such occurrences the finger of a directing Providence, and to consider
      them as opportunities purposely thrown in our way, for the use or abuse of
      which we should one day be called to account, as for every talent
      committed to our charge. Holding these opinions, he could not be content
      to sit down quietly with the knowledge of which he had become possessed
      without making some effort to prevent Lord Bellefield from successfully
      accomplishing the evil he could not doubt he meditated. But what then
      should he do? The question was not an easy one to answer. The most natural
      and effectual means to employ would be to inform General Grant of the
      affair; he was the person likely (as the father of his future bride) to
      possess most influence over Lord Belle-field, while as possessor of the
      estate on which they resided he was certain to meet with respect and
      obedience from the parents of the girl. But besides the dislike every
      honourable man feels to undertake the office of tale-bearer, Lewis&rsquo;s
      chivalrous nature shrank from even the appearance of seeking to wreak his
      revenge on the man who had insulted him, by injuring him in the opinion of
      his future father-in-law. Again, were he to find out the girl and
      expostulate with her, he felt certain he should produce no good effect&mdash;the
      fact of her being aware of the terms on which he stood with her admirer
      would render her suspicious of his intentions, and prevent her from paying
      any regard to his arguments. At last it occurred to him to mention the
      thing to Charles Leicester, and persuade him, if possible, to visit the
      girl, and at all events to make her aware of the deceit which had been
      practised upon her by his brother in assuming his name. Accordingly, he
      determined to seek an early opportunity of speaking to Leicester on the
      subject; but good resolutions are always more easy to form than to carry
      into effect. On the following morning Leicester went to town, as well to
      acquaint his father with the important step he contemplated as to bear in
      person an invitation to an old family friend and <i>ci-devant</i> guardian
      of Laura Peyton&rsquo;s to join the party at Broadhurst; nor did he return till
      after several days had elapsed, so that it was nearly a week ere Lewis
      found the opportunity he sought for.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a dinner-party at Broadhurst, and, as was the custom of the
      neighbourhood, the guests had departed early. Lewis waited till Leicester
      had disposed of a lady whom he was handing to a carriage, then drawing him
      aside, he made him acquainted with the interview which he had
      involuntarily witnessed, informing him at the same time of his object in
      so doing. As he proceeded with his tale Leicester&rsquo;s brow grew dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really too bad of Bellefield,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;situated as he is in
      regard to this family; it shows a want of all proper feeling&mdash;all
      delicacy of mind&mdash;assuming my name, too! Suppose it had come to
      Laura&rsquo;s ears by any chance&mdash;&rsquo;pon my word I&rsquo;ve a great mind to
      speak to him about it&mdash;though, I don&rsquo;t know, it would only lead to a
      quarrel&mdash;Bellefield is not a man to brook interference. I feel quite
      as you do in regard to the affair, my dear Arundel, but really I don&rsquo;t see
      that I can do anything that would be of the slightest use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you can find out the girl and prove to her the truth of my
      statement, that your brother has deceived her by assuming your name&mdash;you
      owe that to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would be certain to tell him of it the next time she sees him,&rdquo;
       returned Leicester uneasily; &ldquo;it would lead to a quarrel between us, and
      you don&rsquo;t know what Bellefield&rsquo;s resentment is when it&rsquo;s once excited&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      actually terrific, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for your cousin, Miss Grant&rsquo;s sake, you ought not to let your brother
      proceed with this affair,&rdquo; urged Lewis; &ldquo;surely you must see the matter in
      this light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! poor Annie,&rdquo; returned Leicester with a half sigh; &ldquo;I sometimes wish
      that engagement had never been entered into. I doubt whether they are at
      all calculated to render each other happy. In fact, I&rsquo;ve learned to look
      upon marriage in a very different light lately. However, it&rsquo;s no business
      of mine; wiser heads will have to settle it, luckily&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      paused, and after a few moments&rsquo; deliberation resumed abruptly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
      as you advise, Arundel. I&rsquo;ll see this girl and talk to her, and if
      Bellefield hears of it and makes himself disagreeable, why it can&rsquo;t be
      helped, that&rsquo;s all. He should not attempt such things, particularly in
      this neighbourhood. He ought to have more respect for the General and his
      daughter; it shows a want of good taste and good feeling. Besides, as well
      as I can judge from the glimpse I had of her in the refreshment-room, the
      girl&rsquo;s not so unusually pretty, after all. She&rsquo;d an awful pair of hands,
      if I recollect right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A contemptuous smile passed across Lewis&rsquo;s handsome features as his
      companion promulgated the above original moral distinction. Leicester,
      however, did not observe it, and continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just fancy my coming out in the character of a virtuous mentor. I only
      hope I shall get through my arduous duties without laughing at my own
      performance. &rsquo;Pon my word, though, it&rsquo;s rather serious when a man
      feels inclined to scoff at himself for doing his duty from the sheer
      inconsistency of the thing. I tell you what, Arundel, I believe I&rsquo;ve been
      a very naughty boy without in the least knowing it. I&rsquo;ve always considered
      myself the victim of circumstances, and set all my peccadilloes down to
      that account; but I don&rsquo;t see why I need bother you by making you my
      father confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, considering the train of thought into which Leicester had fallen,
      one likely to lead to useful, practical results, was about to encourage
      him to proceed, when a servant approached them and placed a small,
      crumpled, and not over clean piece of paper in Lewis&rsquo;s hand. Holding it
      under the light of a lamp, he was enabled with difficulty to decipher the
      following words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Muster Arundel.&mdash;Sur, the party as you knows of is hout to-night,
      and more of his sort along vith him. Ve are safe for a shindy; but being
      quite ready for ther blackguards, lives in good &rsquo;opes hof a capture&mdash;hin
      which hif you likes to assist, not minding a crack o&rsquo; ther head, should
      sich occur, which will sometimes in ther best regerlated famurlies, pleas
      to follur ther bearer, as will conduct you to your humbel servaunt to
      commarnd,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J. Millar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s glorious!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, placing the missive in the hands of
      his companion. &ldquo;I never did catch a poacher in my life, but I&rsquo;ve often
      wished to do so; the whole scene must be so picturesque and unlike
      anything one has ever met with&mdash;the darkness, the excitement&mdash;but
      you are laughing at my eagerness. Well, I confess to a love of adventure
      for its own sake; if I&rsquo;d lived in the middle ages I should have been a
      knight-errant, that&rsquo;s certain. I suppose it&rsquo;s no use asking you to join
      us? There&rsquo;s metal more attractive in the drawing-room, <i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned Charley, arranging his neckcloth by aid of a glass placed
      in the cloak-room for the benefit of the ladies who wished to wrap up
      becomingly, &ldquo;really I must own I prefer Laura&rsquo;s smiles even to the
      delights of a possible <i>rencontre</i> with your friend, Mr.
      What&rsquo;s-his-name, the poacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardy is the fellow&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; replied Lewis. &ldquo;He is a chartist and all
      sorts of horrors, so that I don&rsquo;t feel the smallest degree of sympathy for
      him. Do you know where the General is to be found? I suppose, as I may be
      very late, or even obliged to sleep at Millar&rsquo;s cottage, I must ask his
      sanction ere I start on my expedition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; returned Leicester; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in the library. I saw
      him go there after he had seen Lady Runnymede to her carriage; so
      good-night. I shall be curious to learn in the morning whose brains have
      been knocked out.&rdquo; And with this agreeably suggestive remark Leicester
      ended the conversation and strolled off to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis proceeded at once to the library, where he found not only General
      Grant, but, to his extreme annoyance, Lord Bellefield also; there was,
      however, no help for it, and he accordingly explained his wishes as
      briefly as possible. The General heard him to the end without speaking.
      His first idea was that such a request was strange and unbecoming the
      peaceful gravity that should environ the office of a tutor, and he
      intended to favour him with a dignified refusal; but as Lewis proceeded,
      his eager tones and sparkling eyes recalled to the old officer the days of
      his youth when the spirit of enterprise was strong within him, and in the
      wild bivouac, the dashing assault, the hand-to-hand struggle &ldquo;i&rsquo; the
      imminent deadly breach,&rdquo; and the many exciting vicissitudes of a
      campaigning life, he had found a degree of pleasure which his age knew
      not, and he was fain to accord a gracious assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was a soldier, Mr. Arundel, I think you told me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis replied in the affirmative, mentioning some engagement in which he
      had particularly distinguished himself The General listened to him with
      complacency, then exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir, that&rsquo;s it! I confess when I first heard your request, I
      considered it unnatural, in fact, unbecoming in a civilian, but in a
      soldier&rsquo;s son it assumes an entirely different character. I like to see
      spirit in a young man.&rdquo; (Here he glanced at Lord Bellefield, who,
      apparently engrossed by a legal document which he was perusing, seemed
      unconscious of Lewis&rsquo;s presence.) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity your father! was unable to
      afford you a commission: there&rsquo;s been some very pretty fighting in India
      lately, and you might have distinguished yourself.&rdquo; He paused, then added,
      &ldquo;I know most of the agricultural labourers about here; did Millar tell you
      any of these poachers&rsquo; names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardy, a blacksmith, was the most notorious character,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he mentioned the name Lord Bellefield started so violently that he
      nearly overturned the lamp by which he was reading. Seeing the General&rsquo;s
      eyes fixed on him inquiringly, he rose, and putting his hand to his side,
      drew a deep breath as he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of those sharp stitches, as they call them&mdash;nothing worse. You
      know I am subject to them; it&rsquo;s want of exercise producing indigestion. I
      tell you what,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rather a curiosity to witness Mr.
      Arundel&rsquo;s prowess, and see what sport this poacher will afford.
      Man-hunting, in the literal <i>feræ naturæ</i> sense of the term, will be
      a new excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go,&rdquo; exclaimed the General, springing up with the alertness of
      a young man. &ldquo;If these rascals choose to trespass on my land and destroy
      my property, who so fit to resist them and bring them to justice as
      myself? I&rsquo;ll make the necessary alterations in my dress, and we&rsquo;ll start
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield urged the lateness of the hour, the cold night air, the
      chance of danger to life or limb&mdash;but in vain; General Grant had
      taken the crotchet into his head, and he was not the man to be easily
      induced to change his mind. Accordingly Lewis found himself suddenly
      associated with two as strange companions as ever a man was embarrassed
      withal. Still there was no help for it; and inwardly pondering what
      possible reason Lord Bellefield could have for joining the expedition, and
      why he had started at the mention of Hardy&rsquo;s name, Lewis hastened to wrap
      himself in a rough pea-jacket, and selected a heavy knotted stick,
      wherewith he proposed to knock respect for the rights of property into the
      head of any misguided individual who might be deaf to all milder argument.
      As he returned to the hall the General made his appearance, carrying under
      his arm a cavalry sabre; his bearing was even more stiff and erect than
      usual, and his eye flashed with all the fire of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early on parade, I see, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; he said, with something more nearly
      approaching to a smile on his countenance than Lewis had ever previously
      observed there. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll read those poaching rascals a lesson they will not
      easily forget, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a light footstep was heard approaching, and in another moment
      Annie Grant bounded down the staircase, her glossy curls streaming wildly
      over her shoulders, and her cheeks flushed with the speed at which she had
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear papa!&rdquo; she began, then turning pale as her eye fell upon the
      sword, she continued: &ldquo;Oh! it is really true! I hoped they were only
      deceiving me in jest. Dearest papa, you will be good and kind, and not go
      out after these men? Suppose any accident should occur? think how valuable
      your life is&mdash;papa, you will not go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie, I thought you were perfectly aware of my extreme dislike to, or I
      may say disapproval of all uncalled-for displays of feeling. I am about to
      perform a duty incumbent on my position, and I need scarcely add that any
      attempt to induce me to neglect that duty will not only prove ineffectual,
      but will be highly displeasing to me. Not another word,&rdquo; he continued,
      seeing she was about to resume her entreaties; &ldquo;return immediately to the
      drawing-room and apologise to our friends in my name for being obliged to
      leave them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a servant announced that his master&rsquo;s shooting pony was at
      the door, and that Lord Bellefield had already started; so placing his hat
      on his head with an air of offended dignity, the General marched proudly
      out of the hall. Lewis was about to follow him, when, glancing at Annie,
      he perceived that she had sunk into a chair, and covering her face with
      her hands, had given way to an irrepressible burst of tears. The young
      tutor paused&mdash;wishing to reassure her by promising to use his best
      efforts to shield her father from danger, and yet fearing to intrude upon
      her grief. In his embarrassment he accidentally dropped his stick;
      starting at the sound, Annie for the first time perceived him, and
      springing up, she came hurriedly towards him, exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Arundel! I am so glad you are going. <i>You</i> will take care of
      papa, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she laid her hand on his arm and gazed up into his face
      imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will most assuredly try to do so, Miss Grant,&rdquo; returned Lewis calmly,
      though that light touch thrilled through him like a shock of electricity.
      &ldquo;You need not alarm yourself so greatly,&rdquo; he continued, anxious to soothe
      her; &ldquo;believe me, your apprehensions have greatly exaggerated any probable
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really think so?&rdquo; returned Annie doubtfully. &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; she
      continued, &ldquo;I shall be much happier now I know you are going. I am sure
      you will try and take care of papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, indeed,&rdquo; returned Lewis earnestly, as, glancing towards the door,
      he essayed to depart; but Annie, completely engrossed by her anxiety to
      secure his services on her father&rsquo;s behalf, still unconsciously retained
      her hold on his arm, and Lewis was obliged gently to remove the little
      hand that detained him. As their fingers met, Annie, becoming suddenly
      aware of what Miss Livingstone would have termed her &ldquo;indiscreet and
      unpardonable heedlessness,&rdquo; blushed very becomingly; then with a sudden
      impulse of gratitude and warm feeling she extended her hand to Lewis,
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much for all your kindness, Mr. Arundel. Mind you take
      good care of yourself as well as of papa&mdash;I shall not go to bed till
      I hear you have brought him safe home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis pressed the fair hand offered to him, repeated his assurances that
      her alarm was unnecessary, and hastened to follow General Grant. Annie
      gazed after him with tearful eyes, but his words comforted her. She had
      already begun to rely on him in moments of difficulty or of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was shining brightly, though flitting clouds passed from time to
      time across its silvery disc, wrapping wood and hill and valley in
      momentary darkness, only to enhance their beauty when its pale, cold rays
      once more fell uninterruptedly upon them, imparting to the scene the magic
      of a fairy twilight. Such, however, were scarcely Lewis&rsquo;s thoughts as,
      haunted by the appealing expression of Annie&rsquo;s soft eyes, he hastened to
      overtake his companions. The party proceeded in silence, following their
      guide, who was none other than the renegade &ldquo;Villiam,&rdquo; across one of the
      wildest portions of the park towards a young larch plantation covering
      about forty acres of ground. This spot, named Tod&rsquo;s Hole Spinney, from
      certain fox earths that had existed in it till their occupants&rsquo; partiality
      for dining on pheasants had led to their ejectment, was considered, from
      its isolated situation, the thick growth of underwood, the fact of a
      running stream passing through it, and other propitious circumstances, the
      most amply stocked preserve on the property, and it was with a degree of
      annoyance proportioned to the enormity of the offence that the General
      learned this was the place selected by the poachers for the scene of their
      depredations. As they approached the spot the report of a gun was heard,
      followed by three or four others in rapid succession. General Grant,
      irritated beyond control by this audacity, immediately rode forward at a
      brisk trot. Lewis, bearing in mind Annie&rsquo;s injunction, grasped the crupper
      of the saddle firmly with his left hand, and with this slight assistance
      ran by the General&rsquo;s side, keeping pace with the horse. In this manner
      they had nearly reached the wood, when a man sprang from behind a bush,
      and would have seized the horse&rsquo;s bridle had not Lewis interposed, saying,
      in a low voice, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know us, Millar? it is General Grant, who, when
      he heard the poachers were out, determined to come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg yer honour&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; returned the keeper, touching his hat as he
      recognised his master. &ldquo;I never expected to ha&rsquo; seen you here to-night, to
      be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am usually to be found where my duty calls me,&rdquo; returned the General
      stiffly. &ldquo;These scoundrels seem to be out in force,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, I take it there&rsquo;s as many on &rsquo;em as ve shall know wot to do
      with,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got above a dozen men on the look-hout,
      only in course they&rsquo;re scattered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you propose to act?&rdquo; inquired the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thort of taking a party into the wood, trying to captiwate long Hardy
      and one or two of the ringleaders, chaps as I&rsquo;ve had my eye on for ever so
      long; then take ther game from the tothers, and seize their guns hif
      posserbul. But the chief thing is to captiwate that willain Hardy; so I
      means to leave three or four men on the look-hout, in case he manages to
      do us and break cover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your plan seems a good one,&rdquo; returned the General reflectively. &ldquo;How many
      men do you propose to take into the wood with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, there&rsquo;s half-a-dozen lads a laying down behind those bushes yonder,
      and there&rsquo;s two more jist inside that gap; then there&rsquo;s myself and Muster
      Arundel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the boy that guided us hold my horse,&rdquo; began General Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hif I might adwise,&rdquo; interrupted Millar, &ldquo;yer honour would remain in this
      wery place; and hif Hardy should get away from us&mdash;as he&rsquo;s likely
      enough, for he&rsquo;s as strong and houdacious as a steam-ingine&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      a-most sure to break cover here; in vich case yer honour can ride him
      down, and hif he dares to show fight, give him a cut hover the skull with
      yer long sword there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel sure he will endeavour to effect his retreat on this side?&rdquo;
       inquired the General doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartain sure, I may say,&rdquo; cried Millar confidently; then, as his master
      turned to explain to Lord Bellefield, who had just come up, the plan of
      operations, he added in a low voice, so that Lewis only might hear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old Gineral&rsquo;s pluckey enough for anything, but his legs ain&rsquo;t so
      young as they used to be, and he&rsquo;s rather touched in the vind, vich von&rsquo;t
      do for sich a valk as we&rsquo;ve got before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment more shots were heard in the wood, but apparently much
      nearer than the last. The poachers were evidently advancing in that
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a moment to be lost, Millar,&rdquo; exclaimed the General eagerly.
      &ldquo;I think as you say, I may be of more use here. Some one <i>must</i>
      remain outside to cut off the retreat of these fellows if you should
      succeed in driving them out of the wood. Lord Bellefield will accompany
      your party. Where are the other watchers on this side stationed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About fifty yards apart, along the ditch skirting the wood. If yer honour
      wants help, a note on this whistle will produce it.&rdquo; So saying, Millar
      handed him an ivory dog-whistle; then signing to &ldquo;Villiam&rdquo; to proceed, and
      requesting Lord Bellefield and Lewis to follow him, the keeper conducted
      them along a narrow track leading into the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really expect that Hardy will attempt to cross that part of the
      park, or was your assertion merely a white lie, framed to secure the
      General&rsquo;s safety?&rdquo; asked Lewis as he walked by the keeper&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, it worn&rsquo;t altogether a lie,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;for if we don&rsquo;t nab
      the gentleman, that&rsquo;s the side he&rsquo;ll try for, as it&rsquo;s easiest for him to
      get away; but if I vonce has a fair hit at him, I don&rsquo;t mean to leave him
      a chance to get away. I shall not stand nice about hurting him neither, I
      can tell yer. He beat Sam Jones, one o&rsquo; my hunder-keepers, so savage that
      the poor feller worn&rsquo;t out of his blessed bed for two months. He deserves
      summut pretty strong for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you point him out to me, if you catch sight of him,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis.
      &ldquo;I am most anxious to be introduced to this truculent gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer can&rsquo;t mistake him hif yer once sets eyes on him,&rdquo; returned the
      keeper; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s half a head taller than any of the rest of &rsquo;em, but
      I&rsquo;ll show him to yer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke they reached the spot where the six men were waiting, though,
      so well had they concealed themselves, Lewis was close upon them ere he
      was aware of their vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my lads, are yer all ready?&rdquo; inquired their leader in a low voice.
      An answer in the affirmative was followed by the order&mdash;&ldquo;Come on,
      then;&rdquo; when Lord Bellefield interposed by saying, &ldquo;One moment! Listen to
      me, my men: I offer five guineas reward to any of you who may secure
      Hardy.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;IS CHIEFLY CULINARY, CONTAINING RECIPES FOR A &ldquo;GOOD
      PRESERVE&rdquo; AND A &ldquo;PRETTY PICKLE.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter a strict
      injunction from Millar to preserve silence, the party in search of Hardy
      and his associates again moved forward, Lord Belle-field, Millar, and
      Lewis in front, and the others following two abreast. As soon as they had
      entered the wood the remaining men joined them, making altogether a
      company of eleven. As they advanced farther into the plantation, the
      boughs of the trees, becoming thicker and more closely interlaced,
      intercepted the moonlight and rendered their onward progress a matter of
      some difficulty. The gamekeepers however, knew every intricacy of the
      path, and could have found his way in the darkest night as easily as at
      noonday. After winding among the trees for some minutes they came upon a
      little glade where the underwood had been partially cleared away and a
      small quantity of barley stacked for the purpose of feeding the pheasants.
      At the entrance to the space thus cleared the party halted, and Millar,
      creeping forward on his hands and knees, reached the stack. Sheltering
      himself behind it, he made his way to the opposite side, where he was lost
      to sight; reappearing almost immediately, he cautiously rejoined the
      others, saying in a low whisper: &ldquo;I expected how it would be; there is
      from twenty or thirty pheasands roosting on the trees beyond the stack
      there, and Hardy and his mates being aware on it, is a-making of their way
      through the bushes right ahead. I could hear &rsquo;em plain enough when
      I was at the stack yonder. Now, two on yer must come along o&rsquo; me, creep to
      the stack and hide behind it as yer see me do, then vait till them
      blackguards has let fly at the pheasands, and afore they can load again ve
      three must jump forrard and try and captiwate Hardy. In the meantime, you
      others must make yer way round through the bushes and take &rsquo;em in
      the rear, and help us if we wants helping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you will do most certainly,&rdquo; returned Lord Bellefield. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead
      the party that remains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go with you, Millar,&rdquo; observed Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Sam,&rdquo; continued Millar, addressing the under-keeper before
      alluded to. The man came forward, and placing himself by Lewis&rsquo;s side, the
      three crept along till they had reached the stack, sheltered by which they
      again stood upright. Scarcely had they taken their places when two guns,
      followed by four others, were discharged in rapid succession, and so close
      to them, that the shot pattering amongst the underwood was distinctly
      audible, and one of the wounded pheasants dropped at Lewis&rsquo;s feet; while
      almost immediately afterwards a couple of men ran forward to collect the
      fallen game. The foremost of these was a fellow of Herculean proportions:
      as he stooped to pick up a pheasant a ray of moonlight revealed his
      features, and Lewis immediately recognised his former antagonist, the tall
      Chartist. At the same moment Millar whispered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our man; go ahead!&rdquo;

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him to me,&rdquo; returned Lewis eagerly; and bending forward, with a
      bound like that of a tiger he sprang upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poacher was taken so completely by surprise (his back being turned
      towards his assailant) that Lewis, encircling him with a grasp of iron,
      was enabled to pinion his arms to his sides. Like a wild bull caught in
      the toils, his struggles to free himself were tremendous; but Lewis, now
      in the full vigour of his strength, was an adversary not easily to be
      shaken off, and despite his unrivalled powers, the poacher failed to
      extricate his arms. Shouting, therefore, to his companion for assistance,
      he desired him, with an oath, to shoot the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; keeper;
      but that individual was unable to comply with his comrade&rsquo;s benevolent
      suggestion by reason of certain well-directed blows wherewith Sam Jones,
      the under-keeper, was producing a marked alteration in the general outline
      of his features. In the meantime, Millar, drawing forth a piece of cord,
      began coolly to tie Hardy&rsquo;s wrists together, disregarding a series of
      ferocious kicks with which he assailed him. At this moment the other
      poachers, to the number of some half-dozen, attracted by the sound of
      blows, reached the scene of action, but the party led by Lord Bellefield
      were equally on the alert, and the fight became general. And now the
      capture of the poacher Hardy appeared certain: exhausted by his unavailing
      struggles to free himself from Lewis&rsquo;s encircling arms, he could offer no
      effectual resistance to Millar, who continued most methodically to bind
      his wrists, in no way diverted from his purpose by the storm of blows
      which raged around him, many of which fell on his unprotected person, when
      suddenly the report of a pistol rung sharply above the other sounds of the
      combat, and an acute, stinging pain darted through Lewis&rsquo;s left shoulder,
      causing him such agony for the moment that he involuntarily relaxed his
      grasp. Hardy was not slow to avail himself of the opportunity thus
      offered. Flinging off the young tutor with so much violence that he would
      have fallen had not one of the gamekeeper&rsquo;s assistants caught him and
      prevented it, he wrenched his hands from Millar&rsquo;s grasp, and raising them,
      still bound together as they were, struck the keeper such a severe blow on
      the side of the head that he reeled and fell; then seeing that his
      companions, overpowered by numbers and disheartened by his supposed
      capture, were giving way on all sides, he turned, and dashing into the
      bushes, disappeared, not so quickly, however, but that Lewis, who, despite
      his wound, had never taken his eyes off him for a moment, perceived the
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grasping his stick, which he had contrived to retain during the struggle,
      firmly with his right hand, he lost no time in following the fugitive, and
      guided by the crashing of the bushes, kept close on his traces till they
      reached the boundary hedge; breaking his way through this obstacle with
      the strength and fury of some wild animal, the poacher sprang across the
      ditch into the open park beyond. Seeing that he had a desperate man to
      deal with, and fearing that although the first severe pain had abated, and
      little more than a sensation of numbness remained, his left arm might
      prove in some degree incapacitated by the wound he had received, Lewis
      paused a moment to reconnoitre ere he followed him. To his great delight,
      he perceived he had reached the hedge along the side of which the watchers
      were stationed, near the spot where General Grant had taken up his
      position. Hardy, unconscious how closely he was followed, stopped also a
      moment while he endeavoured to set free his wrists; but so securely had
      Millar bound them, that although by a violent exertion of strength he
      contrived to render the cord slacker, he was unable wholly to succeed in
      his object. Fearing, however, that the cord would not hold out much
      longer, and unwilling to lose the only advantage gained by his previous
      struggle, Lewis determined once more to endeavour to seize him. Shouting,
      therefore, to give notice to the watchers where their assistance was
      likely to be required, he sprang across the ditch and advanced towards his
      antagonist. At first the poacher appeared inclined to stand his ground;
      but seeing his opponent was armed with a stout stick, and recollecting his
      own defenceless condition, he resolved to trust rather to his unrivalled
      fleetness, and turning away with an exclamation of disappointed rage,
      again betook himself to flight. This portion of the park was clear of
      trees or any other cover for a space of more than half a mile square,
      beyond which lay another larger wood; if Hardy could contrive to reach
      this, his escape would become a matter of certainty. The ground, which had
      once formed part of an ancient Roman camp, lay in terraces, and this
      circumstance gave Hardy, who knew every inch of the country by heart, a
      slight advantage. In speed they were very equally matched; for although
      Lewis, from his youth and light, active make, was perhaps really the
      fleetest, Hardy was in better training. When they first started the
      poacher was about ten yards ahead, and they had reached nearly half the
      centre of the space between the two woods ere Lewis had diminished that
      distance materially. Hitherto they had been running uphill, and the
      poacher&rsquo;s superior condition (as a jockey would term it) enabled him to
      continue his rapid course without the pace telling as much as it did on
      his pursuer; but now the ground began to descend, and Lewis, having saved
      himself for a short distance to recover breath, put forth his whole
      powers, and despite the utmost exertions the poacher was capable of
      making, gained upon him so fast that it was evident that in a few more
      strides he must overtake him. But Hardy&rsquo;s usual good luck appeared not
      even yet to have deserted him, for at the very moment when it seemed
      certain Lewis must come up with him, a cloud obscured the moon, and the
      poacher, taking advantage of this accident to double on his pursuer,
      contrived to make such good use of his knowledge of the ground, that when
      the bright moonlight again enabled Lewis to discern his retreating figure,
      he perceived, to his extreme chagrin and disappointment, that the fugitive
      would gain the wood, and doubtless effect his escape, before he could
      again overtake him. It was then with no small satisfaction that, just as
      he was about to give up the chase as hopeless, he caught sight of a man on
      horseback galloping in a direction which must effectually cut off the
      poacher&rsquo;s retreat. Another moment sufficed to show him that the rider, in
      whom he immediately recognised General Grant, had perceived the fugitive,
      and intended to prevent his escape. Lewis accordingly strained every nerve
      to reach the spot in time to render assistance, more particularly as he
      remarked that Hardy had by some means contrived to set his hands at
      liberty. In spite of his utmost exertions, however, it was evident that
      the encounter would take place before he could arrive; and remembering his
      promise to Annie, it was with mingled feelings of anxiety for her father&rsquo;s
      safety, and self-reproach for having quitted him, that he prepared to
      witness the struggle. As soon as the General perceived the state of
      affairs, he waved his hand as a sign to Lewis; then drawing his sabre,
      stood up in his stirrups and rode gallantly at the poacher, shouting to
      him at the same time to stop and yield himself prisoner. Hardy paid no
      attention to the summons, continuing to run on till he felt the horse&rsquo;s
      breath hot upon his neck; then, as General Grant, after again calling on
      him to &ldquo;surrender, or he would cut him down,&rdquo; prepared to put his threat
      into execution, he dodged aside to avoid the blow, and springing suddenly
      upon the rider, dashed the sword from his hand, and seizing him by the
      throat, endeavoured to drag him off his horse. The old man, though taken
      by surprise, clung firmly to his saddle, and spurring his horse, tried to
      shake off his assailant; but his strength unfortunately was not equal to
      his courage, and the poacher, snatching at the rein, backed the horse till
      it reared almost erect and flung its rider forcibly to the ground.
      Apparently bent on revenge, Hardy, still retaining his grasp on the
      bridle, led the horse over the fallen body of the man, with the brutal
      intention of trampling him to death. But the generous instinct of the
      animal served to frustrate his evil purpose; as, though he led it twice
      directly across its prostrate master, the horse raised its feet and
      carefully avoided treading on him. Striking the animal ferociously on the
      head with his clenched fist, he next attempted to back it in the same
      direction, but the frightened animal sprang aside and plunged so violently
      that he was unable to effect his design. He was still striving to do so
      when Lewis, breathless with the speed at which he had run, reached the
      spot. Instantly leaping over the fallen man, stick in hand, he struck
      Hardy so severe a blow on the wrist that he was forced to quit his hold on
      the bridle, and the scared horse broke away and galloped off, snorting
      with terror. The poacher, infuriated by the pain of the blow, forgot all
      prudential considerations; and heedless of the approach of three of the
      watchers, who, attracted by the noise of the struggle, were rapidly
      hastening towards the spot, he rushed upon Lewis, and disregarding a heavy
      blow with which the young tutor greeted him, flung his arms round him and
      endeavoured to dash him to the ground. Fortunately for Lewis, he was not
      ignorant of the manly exercise of wrestling, and his proficiency in the
      art stood him in good stead at this moment; for, despite his gigantic
      strength, Hardy could not succeed in throwing him. In vain did he lift him
      from the ground; with whatever violence he flung him down, he still fell
      upon his legs; in vain did he compress him in his powerful arms, till
      Lewis felt as if every rib were giving way&mdash;the only effect of his
      exertions was to exhaust his own strength; till, at length taking
      advantage of an incautious movement of his adversary, the young tutor
      contrived to pass his leg behind that of the poacher and thus trip him up.
      His victory was, however, nearly proving fatal to him, for in falling the
      ruffian clutched him by the throat and dragged him down with him. Nor,
      although Lewis being uppermost was enabled to raise himself on one knee
      and return the compliment by inserting his hand within the folds of his
      adversary&rsquo;s neck-cloth, could he force him to relinquish his grasp.
      Fortunately, help was at hand; and just as Lewis began to feel that it was
      becoming serious, and that if the pressure on his throat continued much
      longer he should be strangled outright, the three assistants came up; two
      of them immediately flung themselves upon the poacher, while the third
      dragged Lewis, who was rapidly growing exhausted, from the deadly embrace
      of his prostrate foe. Having with some difficulty succeeded in so doing,
      the man laid him at full length on the grass, and leaving him to recover
      as best he might, turned to assist his companions to secure Hardy. This
      was now a comparatively easy task, for his final struggle with Lewis had
      exhausted even the poacher&rsquo;s strength, and after a futile attempt to rise
      and shake off his captors, he ceased to resist, and submitted in sullen
      silence, while his arms were secured with the General&rsquo;s sword-belt. This
      operation concluded, the man who had rescued Lewis returned to him and
      found him sufficiently recovered to sit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you looked to the General? is he uninjured?&rdquo; was his first question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afear&rsquo;d he&rsquo;s terrible hurt, if he ain&rsquo;t killed outright; leastways
      he&rsquo;s onsensibul, and one of his arms seems crushed like,&rdquo; was the
      consolatory reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh that I had come up a minute sooner!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis in a tone of
      bitter self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have been a dead man if yer had, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;If that
      willian there had had hold of your throat half a minute longer, you&rsquo;d have
      been as stiff as a leg of mutton by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better that I had perished than that this should have occurred,&rdquo; murmured
      Lewis; then turning to the man, he continued, &ldquo;Lend me your arm; I can
      walk now,&rdquo; and rising with difficulty, he advanced towards the spot where
      General Grant lay. He was perfectly insensible; his hat had fallen off,
      and his grey hair, exposed to the night dews, imparted, as the moonlight
      streamed on it, a ghastly expression to his features, while his right arm
      was bent under him in an unnatural position, which left no doubt that it
      must be broken, probably in more places than one. Lewis knelt down beside
      him, and raising his uninjured hand, placed his finger on the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can feel his pulse beat distinctly,&rdquo; he observed, after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause. &ldquo;He is not dead, nor dying; indeed, except the injury to his arm, I
      hope he may not be seriously hurt. No time must be lost in carrying him to
      the house and procuring a surgeon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody ought to go to Broadhurst to let&rsquo;m know what&rsquo;s happened and get
      us some help. We&rsquo;ve more than we can manage here, you see,&rdquo; urged the
      assistant. &ldquo;It will take two on us to purwent that blackguard Hardy from
      getting away; he won&rsquo;t lose no chance, you may depend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay with General Grant if you&rsquo;ll run to the house,&rdquo; returned Lewis
      feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your arm&rsquo;s a bleeding, sir. Did that willian stab you?&rdquo; inquired the
      assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was hurt in the wood,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you could ride, sir?&rdquo; continued the man; &ldquo; &rsquo;cos if
      you could, I&rsquo;d try and catch the horse&mdash;he&rsquo;s a grazin&rsquo; very quiet
      yonder&mdash;and then you could go to the house, start off one of the
      grooms to fetch a doctor, send some of the people down here to help us,
      get yer own wound dressed, and break the news to the family better than
      such a chap as me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This observation was a true one, and Lewis felt that it was so; therefore,
      although he dreaded the task, and would rather have again encountered the
      dangers he had just escaped than witnessed Annie Grant&rsquo;s dismay and sorrow
      when she should find her dark anticipations realised, he agreed to the
      arrangement; and as the man succeeded in catching the horse almost
      immediately, he mounted with some difficulty and rode off at speed, though
      the rapid motion increased the pain of his wound till it became almost
      insupportable. He reached Broadhurst in less than ten minutes, never
      drawing bridle till he entered the stable-yard, although he turned so
      faint and dizzy on the way that more than once he was nearly falling from
      the saddle. His first act was to despatch a mounted groom to procure a
      surgeon; he next sent off four of the men-servants with a hurdle converted
      into an extemporary litter, giving them exact directions where to find
      their master, and waiting to see that they started without loss of time;
      he then attempted to dismount, but was unable to do so without assistance.
      Having paused a few moments till the faintness had again gone off, he
      entered the house by the servants&rsquo; entrance, and calling the butler aside,
      desired him to summon Mr. Leicester as quietly as possible; then, sinking
      into a chair and resting his head on his hands, he awaited his arrival
      with ill-con sealed anxiety, dreading lest some incautious person should
      abruptly inform Annie of her father&rsquo;s accident.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII&mdash;LEWIS MAKES A DISCOVERY AND GETS INTO A &ldquo;STATE OF
      MIND.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he end of the room
      at which Lewis had seated himself lay in shadow, so that Leicester, who
      shortly made his appearance wrapped in a dressing-gown, could merely
      distinguish the outline of his figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Arundel,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;is anything the matter? Here has Wilson been
      and roused me out of my first sleep, with a face like that of the party
      who &lsquo;drew Priam&rsquo;s curtains i&rsquo; the dead o&rsquo; the night.&rsquo; Where&rsquo;s Governor
      Grant, and how is it that you&rsquo;re home first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joking matter, Mr. Leicester,&rdquo; returned Lewis faintly, and
      without raising his head. &ldquo;The poachers have given us more trouble than we
      expected, and in attempting to capture Hardy the General has been thrown
      from his horse. His right arm is broken in two places, and when I came
      away he was still insensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the position in which Lewis sat (his elbows resting on a table and
      his forehead supported by his hands) he was unable to perceive anything
      that might be going on in the apartment, consequently he had continued his
      speech, ignorant that a third person had joined them. Annie (for she it
      was who, pale as some midnight ghost, had glided noiselessly into the
      room) laid her hand on Leicester&rsquo;s arm to prevent his calling attention to
      her presence, while eager and trembling she listened to Lewis&rsquo;s account of
      her father&rsquo;s accident; and overcome for the moment by these evil tidings,
      she remained speechless, leaning against a chair for support. Lewis,
      surprised at Leicester&rsquo;s silence, raised his head languidly, and the first
      object that met his eyes was Annie Grant&rsquo;s sinking figure. With an
      exclamation of dismay he attempted to start up, but he was becoming so
      weak from loss of blood that he failed to accomplish his purpose. Roused
      by the action, Annie recovered herself, and as a new idea struck her, she
      asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, then, is poor papa? Have they brought him home? I must go to him
      instantly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not yet arrived, Miss Grant,&rdquo; returned Lewis in a low voice that
      trembled with conflicting emotions; &ldquo;his own servants are carrying him,
      and a surgeon will be here instantly. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he paused abruptly,
      for Annie, drawing herself up, advanced towards him, and with flashing
      eyes exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this then the way in which you have fulfilled your promise, Mr.
      Arundel? I trusted so implicitly to your assurance that you would watch
      over him and protect him; and now you have not only failed him in the
      moment of danger but deserted him in his necessity, and secured your own
      safety by coming home to break my heart with these evil tidings. Oh, I am
      ashamed of you&mdash;grieved&mdash;disappointed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, my dear Annie,&rdquo; observed Leicester soothingly. &ldquo;Arundel might not
      be able to prevent this accident&mdash;you are too hasty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; returned Lewis in a low, broken voice, &ldquo;I deserve her
      reproaches. I ought never to have quitted him, and yet I did so believing
      that I left him in perfect safety. I could not bear to stand inactive when
      other men were about to face danger; besides, I had pledged myself to
      assist in capturing this poacher.&rdquo; He paused, then added, &ldquo;I have been to
      blame, Miss Grant, but I am not quite the poltroon you imagine me. I did
      indeed leave your father that I might accompany the attacking party into
      the wood, but I strained every nerve to come up with Hardy before General
      Grant encountered him; and although that was impossible, I arrived in time
      to prevent him from forcing the horse to trample the life out of the
      fallen man, and wounded as I am, I engaged with and captured, at the risk
      of my own life, the ruffian who had injured your father; nor should I have
      been here now, but that it was necessary for some one to procure
      assistance and summon a surgeon, and I rode back at speed to my own
      injury, that I might leave a more efficient man with the General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he ceased speaking the butler entered the room, bearing in his hand a
      lamp, and for the first time the light fell upon Lewis&rsquo;s figure.
      Leicester, as he beheld him, uttered an exclamation of surprise and
      horror, which his appearance was well calculated to call forth. His face
      was deadly pale, save a red line across the forehead, where some bramble
      had torn the skin; his dark hair, heavy with the night dew, clung in wild
      disorder around his temples; and his clothes, stained with mud, bore
      traces of the severity of the struggle in which he had been engaged; the
      sleeve of his left arm, which still rested on the table, was soaked with
      gore, while the momentary excitement which had animated him as he spoke
      had given way to a return of the faintness produced by the loss of blood,
      which was by this time very considerable. As this ghastly figure met her
      sight Annie uttered a slight shriek&mdash;then a sense of the cruel
      injustice of her own reproaches banished every other consideration, and
      springing towards him, she exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Arundel, what can we do for you? how shocked, how grieved I am!&mdash;will
      you, can you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis smiled and attempted to reply, but the words died away upon his
      lips, and completely overcome by faintness, he would have fallen from the
      chair had not Leicester supported him. Fortunately, at this moment the
      surgeon arrived, and Annie quitting the apartment, Lewis&rsquo;s sleeve was cut
      open, his wound temporarily bound up, and his temples bathed with some
      stimulating essence which dispelled his faintness, before the surgeon&rsquo;s
      services were required for General Grant. The latter gentleman had
      recovered consciousness ere he reached Broadhurst, and though suffering
      acute pain from his broken arm, appeared cool and collected. His first
      question had been &ldquo;whether Hardy had escaped,&rdquo; and he seemed to revive
      from the moment he was informed of his capture. His next inquiry was who
      had taken him, and on learning it was Lewis, he was much pleased,
      muttering, &ldquo;Brave lad, brave lad! pity he&rsquo;s not in the army.&rdquo; He
      recognised Annie and spoke kindly to her, gave orders for the safe custody
      of Hardy, demanded of the surgeon who examined his arm whether he wished
      to amputate it, as he felt quite equal to the operation, and in short,
      under circumstances which would have overpowered any man of less firmness
      of character, behaved like a gentleman and a brave old soldier, as he was.
      Fortunately the surgeons (for a second, attracted by the rumour of an
      accident, as vultures are if a camel dies in the desert, had come to test
      the truth of the old proverb that two heads are better than one) succeeded
      in setting the arm, pronounced amputation unnecessary, and after careful
      examination, gave it as their opinion that, with the exception of a few
      contusions of little consequence, the General had sustained no further
      injury. Having come to this satisfactory conclusion, they found time to
      direct their attention to Lewis. After much whispered consultation and
      considerable exchange of learned winks and profound nods, they informed
      him that he had been wounded by a shot from a pistol (which, by the way,
      he could have told them), and that they had very little doubt that the
      ball remained in the wound, in which case it would be necessary to extract
      it. To this Lewis replied, &ldquo;The sooner the better.&rdquo; Accordingly they
      proceeded to put him to great agony by probing the wound to find the ball,
      after which they hurt him still more in extracting it, performing both
      operations with such easy cheerfulness of manner and utter disregard of
      the patient&rsquo;s feelings, that a bystander would have imagined they were
      carving a cold shoulder of mutton rather than the same joint of live
      humanity. But surgeons, like fathers, have flinty hearts, unmacadamised by
      the smallest grain of pity for the wretched victims of their uncomfortable
      skill; their idea of the &ldquo;Whole Duty of Man&rdquo; being that he should afford
      them &ldquo;an interesting case&rdquo; when living, and become a &ldquo;good subject&rdquo; for
      them when he has ceased to be one to the Queen. After the ball was
      extracted, Lewis requested it might be handed to him; it was small, and
      from its peculiar shape he perceived that it must have been discharged
      from a pistol with a rifle barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will allow me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall keep this bit of lead as a
      memorial of this evening&rsquo;s entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; replied the most cheerful surgeon, &ldquo;by all means; if it
      had but gone an eighth of an inch farther,&rdquo; he added, rubbing his hands
      joyously, &ldquo;only an eighth of an inch, it would have injured the spinal
      cord, and you would have been&mdash;droll how these things occur sometimes&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      have been paralysed for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis shuddered, and wished devoutly he were for the time being Caliph
      Haroun Al&rsquo;Raschid, in which case the facetious surgeon would have added a
      practical acquaintance with the effects of the bastinado on the sole of
      the human foot to his other medical knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; resumed the doctor meditatively, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need
      apprehend any very unpleasant result, as far as I can as yet see into the
      case. Of course,&rdquo; he continued with hilarity, &ldquo;erysipelas might supervene,
      but that is seldom fatal, unless it affects the brain; and I should hope
      the great effusion of blood will prevent that in the present instance. You
      feel very weak, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis replied in the affirmative, and his tormentor continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you need not be uneasy on that score; I don&rsquo;t apprehend a return of
      syncope, but if you should feel an unnatural deficiency of vital heat, or
      perceive any symptoms of approaching collapse, I would advise your ringing
      the bell, and I&rsquo;ll be with you instantly. Scalpel&rsquo;s obliged to be off;
      he&rsquo;s got a very interesting broken leg&mdash;compound fracture&mdash;waiting
      for him down at the village, besides some dozen agreeable minor
      casualties, the result of to-night&rsquo;s work. Keep up your spirits, and go to
      sleep&mdash;your shoulder is easier now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It feels as if the blade of a red-hot sword were being constantly plunged
      into it,&rdquo; returned Lewis crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to hear it,&rdquo; replied Dr. Bistoury, rubbing his hands; &ldquo;just
      what I could have wished; nothing inert there! I would recommend your
      bearing (which word he pronounced bea-a-a-ring) it quietly, and rely upon
      my looking in the first thing to-morrow.&rdquo; So saying he rubbed his hands,
      chuckled, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his wound, which continued very painful, Lewis contrived to
      get a few hours&rsquo; sleep, and awoke so much refreshed that he resisted all
      attempts to keep him in bed, and though stiff and weak to an excessive
      degree, made his way to the study and cheated Walter out of the holiday he
      had expected&mdash;a loss which he scarcely regretted in his joy at
      finding that the wicked poachers had not seriously injured his dear Mr.
      Arundel. And then Annie could not be happy till she had caught Charles
      Leicester and made him accompany her on a penitential visit to Lewis, to
      tell him how grieved she was at the recollection of her injustice to him;
      it seemed so dreadfully ungrateful, when in fact he had just saved her
      father&rsquo;s life; and she looked so pretty and good and pure in her
      penitence, that Lewis began to think women were brighter and higher beings
      than his philosophy had dreamed of, and for the first time it occurred to
      him that he had been guilty of an unpardonable absurdity in despising the
      whole race of womankind because he happened to have been jilted by a
      little, coquettish, half-educated German girl; and he forgave Annie so
      fully in his heart that with his lips he could scarcely stammer out
      half-a-dozen unmeaning words to tell her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester asked him in the course of the conversation whether he had any
      idea which of the gang of poachers had fired the pistol, adding that two
      others had been taken besides Hardy. Lewis paused for a moment ere he
      replied, &ldquo;That his back had been turned towards the man who shot him, and
      that it was too serious a charge to bring against any one without more
      certain knowledge than he possessed on the subject.&rdquo; And having said this,
      he immediately changed the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Annie and her cousin withdrew, Millar the gamekeeper made his
      appearance, full of congratulations on Lewis&rsquo;s gallant conduct and
      sympathy in regard to his wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine vitch o&rsquo; ther warmints could have had a pistol; it worn&rsquo;t
      neither o&rsquo; ther two as we captiwated, for I sarched &rsquo;em myself, and
      never a blessed harticle had they got about &rsquo;em except ther usual
      amount o&rsquo; bacca and coppers hin ther breeches&rsquo; pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have any more fighting after I left you to follow Hardy?&rdquo; asked
      Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, we did &rsquo;ave one more sharpish turn,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;When
      the blackguards see me down, they made a rush to recover the sack with the
      game, and almost succeeded, only Sam Jones pulled me out of the crowd and
      set me on my legs again, and I was so mad a-thinking that Hardy had got
      clear away that I layed about me like one possessed, they do tell me; so
      we not only recovered the game, but bagged two o&rsquo; ther chaps themselves.
      By ther bye,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Sam Jones came here with me; he wants to see
      yer when I&rsquo;ve done with yer; he says he&rsquo;s picked up somethin&rsquo; o&rsquo; yourn,
      but he won&rsquo;t say what&mdash;he&rsquo;s a close chap when he likes, is Sam.
      Howsomdever, I suppose he expects you&rsquo;ll tip him a bob or so, for it was
      he as ketched yer when Hardy first flung yer off. You&rsquo;ve paid <i>him</i>
      for it sweetly, and no mistake; he&rsquo;d got a lovely black hye, and his right
      wrist was swelled as big as two ven we marched him hoff to H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      gaol this morning. And now I&rsquo;ll vish yer good arternoon, Mr. Arundel, and
      send Sam hup, if you&rsquo;re agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, with a smile at the equivocal nature of the phrase, signified his
      agreeability, and the keeper took his departure. In another minute the
      sound of heavy footsteps announced the approach of Sam, who, having obeyed
      Lewis&rsquo;s injunction to &ldquo;come in,&rdquo; vindicated his title to the attribute of
      &ldquo;closeness&rdquo; by carefully shutting the door and applying first his ear and
      then his eye to the keyhole ere he could divest his cautious mind of a
      dread of eavesdroppers. He then crossed the room on tip-toe, partly from a
      sense of the grave nature of his mysterious errand, partly from respect to
      the carpet, the richness of which oppressed him heavily during the whole
      of his visit, restricting him to the use of one leg only the greater
      portion of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found something of mine, Millar tells me,&rdquo; began Lewis, finding
      that, ghost-like, his visitor appeared to consider it a point of etiquette
      not to speak first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; returned his visitor, who, catching sight
      at the moment of the gilt frame of an oil painting which hung over the
      chimney, and believing it firmly to be pure gold, became so overpowered
      between that and the carpet that he scarcely dared trust himself to speak
      in such an aristocratic atmosphere. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, sir. Yes, I
      have found something, sir, but I don&rsquo;t know disactly as it&rsquo;s altogether
      yourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my good fellow?&rdquo; inquired Lewis, half amused and half bored
      by the man&rsquo;s bashfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consolatory mistrust of the sterling value of the picture-frame had by
      this time begun to insinuate itself into Sam&rsquo;s mind, and reassured in some
      degree by the doubt, he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, sir, but I hopes you don&rsquo;t feel so bad as might be
      expected; you looks shocking pale, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis thanked him for his inquiry, and said he believed the wound was
      going on favourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very glad to hear it, which is a mercy to be thankful for;
      you looking so bad, too,&rdquo; returned this sympathising visitor; then leaning
      forward so as to approach his lips to Lewis&rsquo;s ear, he continued in a loud
      whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have ye any notion who it was as fired the shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis started, and colouring slightly, fixed his eyes on the man&rsquo;s face as
      he inquired abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forgetting his veneration for the carpet in the excitement of the
      conversation, the suspicious under-keeper walked to the door and again
      tested the keyhole ere he ventured to answer the question; then
      approaching Lewis, he thrust his hand into a private pocket in his
      shooting-jacket, and drawing thence something carefully wrapped in a
      handkerchief, he presented it to the young tutor, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been and found, sir; I picked it up in the wood, not
      twenty yards from the place where you stood when you was shot, Mr.
      Arundel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis hastily unrolled the handkerchief, and drew from its folds a small
      pocket-pistol; <i>on</i> the stock, which was richly inlaid, was a silver
      escutcheon with a coat of arms engraved upon it; from marks about the
      nipple it had evidently been lately discharged, and on examination it
      proved to have <i>a rifle barrel</i>. Lewis&rsquo;s brow grew dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is then as I suspected,&rdquo; he muttered; pausing, however, as a new idea
      seemed to strike him. &ldquo;It might be unintentional,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the mere
      result of accident. I must not jump too hastily to such a conclusion;&rdquo;
       then addressing the under-keeper, he inquired&mdash;&ldquo;Have you any idea to
      whom this pistol belongs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I may have,&rdquo; was the cautious reply, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s some things
      it&rsquo;s best not to know&mdash;a man might get himself into trouble by being
      too knowing, you see, Mr. Arundel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my good friend,&rdquo; returned Lewis, fixing his piercing glance
      on the man&rsquo;s face: &ldquo;it is evident you more than suspect who is the owner
      of this pistol, and you probably are aware by whom, and under what
      circumstances, it was last night discharged. Now, if through a selfish
      dread of consequences you wish to keep this knowledge to yourself, why
      come here and show me the pistol? If, on the contrary, you wish to enhance
      the value of your information in order to make a more profitable bargain
      with me, you are only wasting time. I am naturally anxious to know who
      wounded me, and whether the deed was accidental or intentional; therefore,
      you have but to name your price, and if I can afford it I will give it
      you. I say this because I can conceive no other reason for your
      shilly-shallying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this speech the unfortunate Sam Jones shifted uneasily from leg to
      leg, dropped his cap, stooped to pick it up again, bit his under-lip with
      shame and indecision, and at last exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless&rsquo;d if I can stand this hany longer! out it must come, and if I loses
      my sitiation through it, I suppose there&rsquo;s other places to be got; they
      can&rsquo;t say nuffin against my character, that&rsquo;s one comfort. It ain&rsquo;t your
      money I wants, Mr. Arundel, sir; I&rsquo;m able and willin&rsquo; to earn my own
      livin&rsquo;; but I&rsquo;ve got a good place here, and don&rsquo;t wish to offend nobody:
      still right is right, and knowing what I knows, my conscience wouldn&rsquo;t let
      me rest till I&rsquo;d come and told you&mdash;only I thort if you would ha&rsquo;
      guessed it of yourself like, nothing needn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; come out about me in the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; returned Lewis with a contemptuous curl of the lip; &ldquo;I
      will take care not to commit you in any way; so speak out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you remember, sir, I went with you and Millar up to the
      barley-stack last night, and when you grabbed hold of Hardy he sung out to
      the chap as was with him to come and help him, so I thort the best thing
      for me was to pitch into him and prevent his doing so. Well, I hadn&rsquo;t much
      trouble with him, for he was a shocking poor hand with his fists, and as
      soon as I&rsquo;d polished him off I turned to lend you a help; just at that
      minute I see the moon a-shining upon something bright, and looking
      further, I perceived the figure of a man crouching close to the stack with
      a cocked pistol in his hand. When fust I see him the pistol was pointed at
      Hardy, but suddenly he changed his aim and fired straight at you; as he
      let fly, the moonlight fell upon his face, and if ever a man looked like a
      devil he did then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; asked Lewis eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Bellefield!&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s none of &rsquo;em wears hair
      on their top lip except the young lord, so it ain&rsquo;t easy to mistake him,
      ye see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure he changed the direction of the pistol? Might not the
      shot have been intended for Hardy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my oath it worn&rsquo;t, Mr. Arundel; he pointed it straight at your
      breast, and if Hardy hadn&rsquo;t given a sudden wrench at the minute and
      dragged you out of the line of fire, you&rsquo;d have been a dead man long
      before this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Lewis continued silent, the keeper resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you was hit you let go and Hardy threw you off. I caught you,
      expecting it was all up with you, but I still kept my eye on his lordship,
      for I was curious to know how he&rsquo;d act. When he saw you fall he smiled,
      and then he looked more like a devil than he had done before. As Hardy was
      a-cutting away he passed close to Lord Bellefield and struck against his
      shoulder, accidently, and his lordship in a rage flung the discharged
      pistol after him, and it would ha&rsquo; fetched him down too if it hadn&rsquo;t a-hit
      against a branch. However, I marked where it fell pretty nigh, and as soon
      as it was light this morning I went and found it. There&rsquo;s his lordship&rsquo;s
      arms upon it, same as them on his pheaton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Completely overpowered and amazed at this recital, Lewis, desiring to be
      alone with his own thoughts, obtained from Sam Jones a promise of the
      strictest secrecy in regard to the affair, and having liberally rewarded
      him for his discreet behaviour, dismissed him. He then, concealing the
      pistol in his pocket, withdrew to the privacy of his own apartment, and
      locking the door, sat down to collect his ideas. At first he could
      scarcely realise the fact with which he had become acquainted. True, he
      had suspected that it was from Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s hand that he had received
      his wound, for he had previously observed the butt of a pistol protruding
      from a pocket in his lordship&rsquo;s greatcoat, his attention being
      particularly called to the fact by the eagerness with which its owner
      immediately hastened to conceal it more effectually. Still, he had
      believed that he had been wounded by an accident, and that the shot had
      been fired with the intention of disabling Hardy, in whose capture Lord
      Bellefield appeared, for some mysterious reason, to be deeply interested.
      The account he had just received proved that this was evidently not the
      case, and Lewis could only conjecture that at the moment Lord Bellefield
      was about to shoot Hardy some fiend had suggested to him the opportunity
      of an easy revenge on the man he hated, and that, in an impulse of
      ungovernable malice, he had altered the direction of the pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising and opening his dressing-case, Lewis took from a secret drawer the
      ball which had been extracted from his shoulder, and drawing the pistol
      out of his pocket, tried it; it fitted the barrel to a nicety. Replacing
      it, he muttered, &ldquo;There is then <i>no</i> doubt.&rdquo; He paused, but
      immediately resumed, &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis well; he has now filled up the measure
      of his guilt; the time is come to balance the account.&rdquo; His intention at
      that moment was to seek out Lord Bellefield, upbraid him with his
      treachery, threaten to expose him, and demand as a right that he should
      afford him satisfaction, forcing him by some means to meet him on the
      following morning. But even when carried away by passion, Lewis was not
      utterly forgetful of the feelings of others, and his friendship for
      Leicester and for Annie, consideration for the General in his present
      situation, and the interest he took in Walter, rose up before him, and he
      exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is impossible; a thousand reasons forbid it while I remain under
      this roof. I must break off all intercourse with this family before I seek
      my just revenge. Well, the day of retribution is postponed then, perhaps
      for years; but it will come at last, I know; I feel that it will. That man
      is a part of my destiny. With what pertinacity he hates me! He fears me,
      too; he has done so ever since that affair of the glove. He read in my
      eyes that I had resolved on&mdash;on what? What will all this lead to? Am
      I at heart a murderer?&rdquo; He sat down, for he was very weak, and trembled so
      violently from the intensity of his feelings that his knees refused to
      support him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it is an act of justice. This man insulted me&mdash;I
      bore it patiently; at least I did not actively resent it. He repeated his
      injurious conduct, he heaped insult on insult&mdash;I warned him; he knew
      what he was doing; he saw the fiend he was arousing in me, but he
      persevered&mdash;even yet I strove to forgive him; yes, for the sake of
      his brother&rsquo;s kindness to me, for the sake of the fair girl who is
      betrothed to him, I had almost resolved to forego my right to punish him.
      Then he seeks my life, the cowardly assassin! and in so doing he has
      sealed his own doom.&rdquo; He rose and paced sternly up and down the apartment.
      &ldquo;Frere would say,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;Frere would say that I ought to forgive
      him yet, but he would be wrong. He would quote the Scriptures that we
      should forgive a brother &rsquo;till seventy times seven.&rsquo; Yes, <i>if</i>
      he turn and repent; repented sins only are forgiven either in heaven or on
      earth. Does this man repent? let him tell me so, and I will give him my
      hand in friendship; but if he glories in his wickedness? why then the old
      Hebrew law stands good, &lsquo;An eye for an eye.&rsquo; He owes me a life already,
      and if I offer him fair combat, I give him a chance to which in strict
      justice he has no right; but <i>I</i> am no mean assassin. And now to
      return his pistol and inform his lordship that I am aware of the full
      extent of my obligations to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he drew pen and ink towards him and hastily wrote as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arundel presents his compliments to Lord Bellefield, and begs to
      return the pistol with which he did him the honour to attempt his life in
      the wood last night. Mr. Arundel reserves the pleasure of <i>returning the
      shot</i> till some future opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then rolled up the note, and inserting it in the barrel of the pistol,
      formed the whole into a small parcel, which he carefully sealed, and
      ringing for Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s valet, desired him to lay it on his master&rsquo;s
      dressing-table before he prepared for dinner.
    </p>

      Reader, when your eye falls upon this page, which lays bare the heart of
      one whom we would fain depict, not as a mere picturesque brain-creation of
      impossible virtues and startling faults, but as an erring mortal like
      ourselves, swayed by the same passions, subject to the same influences for
      good or for evil&mdash;when you perceive how this one wrong feeling,
      permitted to take root in his mind, grew and flourished, till it so warped
      his frank, generous nature, that the fiend of sophistry, quoting scripture
      to his purpose, could blind his sense of right with such shallow reasoning
      as the foregoing,&mdash;resolve, if a single revengeful feeling lurk
      serpent-like in your bosom, to cast it from you at whatever sacrifice,
      lest when you pray &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; which is in heaven to &ldquo;forgive us our
      trespasses <i>as</i> we forgive them that trespass against us,&rdquo; you
      unawares pronounce your own condemnation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.&mdash;CONTAINS SUNDRY DEFINITIONS OF WOMAN &ldquo;AS SHE SHOULD
      BE,&rdquo; AND DISCLOSES MRS. ARUNDEL&rsquo;S OPINION OF RICHARD FRERE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ewis did not
      obtain any answer to his polite note, as Lord Belle-field received on the
      following morning letters which he said required his immediate presence in
      London, and in the hurry of departure he no doubt forgot to refute the
      charge Lewis had seen fit to bring against him; and as the young tutor
      preserved a strict silence on the subject, and Sam Jones kept his own
      counsel with his accustomed closeness, there, for the present, the matter
      appeared likely to rest. Some little surprise was caused in the village by
      the sudden disappearance of Jane Hardy, the poacher&rsquo;s daughter, a girl of
      about nineteen; but as it was imagined she had gone to take up her
      quarters in the town of H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, where her father was
      imprisoned, her absence was soon forgotten. Lewis and Charles Leicester
      alone, having ascertained her identity with the young person who had
      assisted in the refreshment-room on the night of the party, connected her
      flight with Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s abrupt departure, and although the subject
      was, for obvious reasons, avoided between them, little doubt remained on
      their minds as to her probable fate. This occurrence afforded Lewis a clue
      to Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s sudden interest in regard to Hardy&rsquo;s capture: by her
      father&rsquo;s imprisonment would be removed the chief impediment to the success
      of his designs upon the daughter. The event had proved the correctness of
      his calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks passed on; the wound in Lewis&rsquo;s shoulder healed, despite the
      aggravating attendance of Doctors Scalpel and Bistoury, and with youth and
      health on his side he speedily regained his accustomed vigour. General
      Grant&rsquo;s recovery was a matter of greater difficulty. The fracture had been
      by no means easily reduced, and the process by which the bones re-united
      was a long and tedious one. His accident (as is usually the case with such
      events) had occurred at a most inconvenient moment. While he was yet
      confined to his room the election for the county came on, and his
      opponent, taking advantage of his absence to undermine his influence with
      the voters, was returned by a large majority. The bribery by which he had
      obtained his seat was, however, a matter of such notoriety, that, by De
      Grandeville&rsquo;s advice, the General was induced to petition Parliament to
      annul the election. The petition failed, and the expenses, which, from the
      prolonged proceedings, were unusually heavy, all fell upon the
      unsuccessful candidate. During the progress of the affair, Lewis, by the
      General&rsquo;s wish, acted as his amanuensis and private secretary, a
      confidential servant being engaged to wait on Walter and attend him during
      his rides, thus relieving his tutor of much that was irksome in his
      situation. The London season was at its height before General Grant had
      recovered sufficiently to leave Broadhurst, but a fortnight before the day
      on which Charles Leicester&rsquo;s wedding was fixed to take place Annie and her
      father started for the great metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his attendance on the General, Lewis had been thrown much into
      Annie&rsquo;s society, and their intimacy had deepened, on the lady&rsquo;s side, into
      feelings of the warmest esteem and friendship, while the gentleman became
      more and more convinced that his previous estimate of the fair sex was a
      completely mistaken one, and altogether to be condemned as the weakest and
      most fallacious theory that ever entered the brain of a hot-headed boy&mdash;by
      which opprobrious epithet he mentally stigmatised his six-months-ago self&mdash;and
      for at least a week after she had departed he felt as if something had
      gone wrong with the sun, so that it never shone properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General had been away about a fortnight, when Lewis received a letter
      from Rose informing him for the first time of her literary pursuits. Since
      we have last heard of this young lady she had been growing decidedly blue.
      Not only had she, under Bracy&rsquo;s auspices, published a series of papers in
      Blunt&rsquo;s Magazine, but she had positively written a child&rsquo;s book, which,
      although it contained original ideas, good sense, and warm feeling,
      instead of second-hand moral platitudes, and did not take that
      particularly natural view of life which represents it as a system of
      temporal rewards and punishments, wherein the praiseworthy elder sister is
      always recompensed with an evangelical young duke, and the naughty boys
      are invariably drowned on clandestine skating expeditions, yet found an
      enterprising publisher willing to purchase it; nay, so well did it answer,
      that the courageous bibliopolist had actually expressed a wish to confer
      with the &ldquo;talented authoress,&rdquo; as he styled poor Rose, in regard to a
      second work. Whereupon Frere despatched a note to that young lady, telling
      her she had better come up to town at once, offering her the use of his
      house in a rough and ready way, just as if he had been writing to a man;
      and though he did add in a postscript that if she fancied she should be
      dull, she&rsquo;d better bring her mother with her, the afterthought was quite
      as likely to have arisen from sheer good-nature, as from any, even the
      most faint, glimmering of etiquette. Owing, to a judicious hint thrown out
      by Bracy, however, an invitation arrived, at the same time, from Lady
      Lombard, which Mrs. Arundel had immediately decided on accepting, and the
      object of Rose&rsquo;s letter was to inquire whether there was the slightest
      hope of Lewis being able to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the same post arrived a note written by Annie from her father&rsquo;s
      dictation, saying that he found he was quite unable to get on without Mr.
      Arundel&rsquo;s assistance; that he considered change of scene might prove
      beneficial to Walter, and that it was therefore his wish that Lewis and
      his pupil should join them immediately after the bustle of the wedding
      should be over; which scheme chimed in with the young tutor&rsquo;s wishes most
      admirably, and for the rest of the morning he was so happy as to be quite
      unlike his usual grave and haughty self, and astonished Faust to such a
      degree by placing his fore-paws against his own chest, and in that
      position constraining him to waltz round the room on his hind-legs, that
      the worthy dog would have assuredly taken out a statute of lunacy against
      his master had he been aware of the existence of such a process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who witnessed the marriage of the Hon. Charles Leicester to the
      lovely and accomplished daughter of the late Peregrine Peyton, Esq., of
      Stockington Manor, in the county of Lancashire (they said nothing of
      Ludgate Hill and ignored Plumpstern totally), describe it to have been a
      truly edifying ceremony. The fatal knot was tied, and the wretched pair
      launched into a married state by the Bishop of L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      the unhappy victims submitting to their fate with unexampled fortitude and
      resignation, and the female spectators evincing by their tears that the
      lesson to be derived from the awful tragedy enacting before them would not
      be thrown away upon them. Nor were the good intentions thus formed allowed
      to swell the list of &ldquo;unredeemed pledges&rdquo; whence that prince of
      pawnbrokers, Satan, is popularly supposed to select his paving materials,
      as, during the ball which concluded the evening, two fine young men of
      property fell victims to premature declarations, and after a rapid decline
      from the ways of good fellowship were carried off by matrimony, and
      departed this (<i>i.e.</i>, fashionable) life in less than two months
      after their first seizure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Lewis&rsquo;s arrival in town he found a small packet directed to him in
      Leicester&rsquo;s handwriting, containing, besides the glazed cards lovingly
      coupled by silver twist, a remarkably elegant gold watch and chain for the
      waistcoat pocket, together with a few lines from Charley himself, saying
      that to Lewis&rsquo;s good advice and plain speaking he felt he in a great
      measure owed his present happiness, and that he hoped Lewis would wear the
      enclosed trifle, the joint gift of himself and Laura, to remind him of
      their mutual friendship and regard. Had he known that Annie Grant had
      noticed the fact of his not possessing a watch, and suggested the nature
      of the gift to her cousin, he would have valued it even more highly than
      he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happy pair had determined to test the endurance of their felicity by
      starting for the Rhine, which popular river it was their intention to go
      up as far as it was go-up-able, then proceed to Switzerland, do that land
      of musical cows and icy mountains thoroughly, and finally take up their
      quarters at Florence, where Leicester had succeeded in obtaining a
      diplomatic appointment. A letter had been received from them dated
      Coblentz, wherein it appeared their newfound happiness had stood the
      voyage better than might have been expected; a fact mainly attributable to
      their having had an unusually calm passage. Laura considered the Rhine
      scenery exquisite; Charley thought it all very well for a change; but for
      a constancy, he must confess he preferred the Serpentine. He was disgusted
      with the German students, whom he stigmatised as &ldquo;awful tigers,&rdquo; wondered
      why the women wore short petticoats if they hadn&rsquo;t better ankles to show,
      complained bitterly of the intense stupidity of the natives for not
      understanding either French or English, and wound up by a long, violent
      sentence quite unconnected with all that had gone before it, setting forth
      his unalterable conviction that Laura was an angel, which unscriptural
      assertion he reiterated four times in as many lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      A change had taken place in Rose Arundel, and Lewis, as he gazed with
      affection on her calm, pensive brow, and marked the earnest, thoughtful
      expression of her soft, grey eyes, felt that she was indeed altered: he
      had left her little more than a child, he found her a woman in the best
      and fullest sense of the expression. Reader, do you know all that phrase
      implies? do you understand what is meant by a woman in the true and
      fullest sense of the term?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? I should rather think I did, too, just a <i>very</i> little,&rdquo; replies
      Ensign Downylip, winking at society at large; &ldquo;know what a woman is? yes,
      I consider that good, rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, oh! most exquisite juvenile, may be your definition of woman as
      she should be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ensign strokes his upper lip where that confounded moustache is so
      very &ldquo;lang a comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; rubs his nose to arouse his intellect, which he
      fails to do because that faculty is not asleep but wanting, and replies&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;well, to begin with: woman is of course a decidedly inferiar
      animal, but&mdash;ar&mdash;take the best specimen of the class, and you&rsquo;ll
      find it vewy pwitty, picquante, devoted to polking, light in hand, clean
      about the pasterns, something like Fanny Elsler, with a dash of Lady&mdash;to
      give it style (I can&rsquo;t stand vulgawity), decidedly fast (I hate your
      cart-horsey gals)! plenty of bustle to make it look spicy, ready to go the
      pace no end, and able properly to&mdash;ahem! appweciate &lsquo;Yours truly&rsquo;&mdash;ar&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      about the time of day, eh, Mr. Author!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing, sir,&rdquo; replies Corulea Scribbler, who is so very superior
      that she is momentarily expected to regenerate society singlehanded, &ldquo;no
      such thing, sir! I know what the author means: he justly considers woman
      as a&mdash;that is, as <i>the</i> concentrated essence of mind; nothing
      low, base, earthy&mdash;but&mdash;in fact&mdash;definitions should be
      terse&mdash;you&rsquo;ll excuse my mathematical tastes, but&mdash;ahem!&mdash;three
      terms at Queen&rsquo;s College, and that dear Professor Baa-lamb! naturally
      produce a logical habit of thought&mdash;you require a perfect woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, I am not so unreasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, you require a definition of a perfect woman; here you have it
      then&mdash;the maximum of mind united to the minimum of matter; or, to
      speak poetically, a &lsquo;thing all soul.&rsquo;&rdquo; And having thus given her opinion,
      Miss Corulea, who measures barely five feet, and is as thin as a lath,
      shakes her straw-coloured ringlets and subsides into the Sixth Book of
      Euclid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither the red-jacket nor the blue-stocking, albeit each the type of
      a not unnumerous class, has exactly answered our question as we would wish
      it replied to. We do not agree with Charley Leicester in considering woman
      an angel; first, because our ideas with regard to angels are excessively
      vague and undefined, wings and white drapery being the only marked
      features which we have as yet succeeded in realising; and secondly,
      because, to verify the resemblance, woman should be faultless, and we have
      never yet met with one who had not some fascinating little sin left to
      show that she was not too good for this world. Our notion of a woman, in
      the best sense of the word, is a being fitted to be a helpmeet for man;
      and this would lead us into another disquisition, which we will dismiss
      summarily by stating that we mean a man worthy of the name, not an ape in
      a red-coat like Ensign Downylip, or an owl in a sad-coloured one like
      Professor Baalamb, but a man whom it would not be mere satire to call a
      lord of the creation. A helpmeet for such an one as this should possess a
      clear, acute intellect, or she would be unable to comprehend his
      aspirations after the good, and true, and beautiful&mdash;the efforts of
      his fallen nature to regain somewhat of its original rank in the scale of
      created beings. She should have a faithful, loving heart, that when,
      foiled in his worldly career, his spirit is dark within him, and in the
      bitterness of his soul he confesses that &ldquo;the good that he would he does
      not, but the evil he would not, that he does,&rdquo; her affection may prove to
      him that in her love he has one inestimable blessing yet remaining, of
      which death alone can deprive him, and then only for a season; for,
      availing herself of the fitting moment with the delicate tact which is one
      of the brightest instincts of a loving woman&rsquo;s heart, she can offer him
      the only true consolation, by urging him to renew his Christian warfare in
      the hope that <i>together</i> they may attain the reward of their high
      calling, a reward so glorious that the mind of man is impotent to conceive
      its nature. But to be able to do this she must herself have realised, by
      the power of faith, the blessedness of things unseen, and with this
      requisite, without which all other excellencies are valueless, we conclude
      our definition of &ldquo;woman as she should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such an one was Rose Arundel, and countless others are there who, if not
      sinless as the radiant messengers of heaven, are yet doing angels&rsquo; work by
      many a fireside which their presence cheers and blesses. Happy is the man
      who possesses in a wife or sister such a household fairy; and if some
      there be who bear alone the burden of life&mdash;whose joys are few, for
      we rejoice not in solitude&mdash;let those whose lot is brighter forgive
      the clouded brow or the cynical word that at times attests the weariness
      of a soul on which the sunlight of affection seldom beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      No particular alteration was observable in Mrs. Arundel, who seemed to
      possess the enviable faculty of never growing older, and who remained just
      as gay and sparkling as when at sixteen she had enslaved the fancy rather
      than the heart of Captain Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lewis,&rdquo; she exclaimed, after having asked a hundred questions in
      a breath regarding the internal economy of General Grant&rsquo;s family, the
      affray with the poachers, Charles Leicester&rsquo;s wedding, and every other
      event, grave or otherwise, which occurred to her active and versatile
      mind, &ldquo;my dear Lewis, what an original your friend Frere is! excessively
      kind and good-natured, but so very odd. He volunteered to come and meet us
      at the coach-office, which I considered quite a work of supererogation;
      but Rose had imbibed such a mistrust of London and its inhabitants, whom
      she expected to eat her up bodily, I believe, that she persuaded me to
      accept his offer. Well, when the coach arrived I looked about, but nobody
      did I see who at all coincided with my preconceived ideas of Mr. Frere,
      and I began to think he would prove faithless, when I descried an
      individual in a vile hat and an old, rough greatcoat perched on a pile of
      luggage, with a cotton umbrella between his knees, reading some dirty
      little book, in which he appeared completely immersed. He took not the
      slightest notice of the bustle and confusion going on around him, and
      would, I believe, have sat there until now, if a porter, carrying a heavy
      trunk, had not all but fallen over him; upon which he started up, and for
      the first time perceiving the coach, exclaimed, &lsquo;By Jove, there&rsquo;s the very
      thing I am waiting for!&rsquo; then shouldering his umbrella, he advanced to the
      window, and thrusting in his great head, growled out, &lsquo;Are any of you Miss
      Arundel?&rsquo; Rose answered the question, for I was so taken by surprise that
      I was dying with laughter. As soon as he had ascertained our identity, he
      continued, &lsquo;Well, then I should say the sooner you&rsquo;re out of this the
      better. I&rsquo;ll call a cab.&rsquo; The moment it drew up he flung open the door,
      and exclaiming, &lsquo;Now, come along,&rsquo; he caught hold of Rose as if she&rsquo;d been
      a carpetbag, dragged her out, and pushed her by main force into the cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma,&rdquo; interrupted Rose apologetically, &ldquo;you really colour the
      matter too highly. Mr. Frere was as kind as possible. He was a little
      rough, certainly, and seemed to think I must be as helpless as a child;
      but I dare say he&rsquo;s not accustomed to act as squire to dames.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed he&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Arundel. &ldquo;But I was determined he
      shouldn&rsquo;t paw me about like a bale of goods, so I rested my hand on a
      porter&rsquo;s shoulder and sprang from the coach into the cab while he was
      stooping to pick up his wretched umbrella; and finely astonished he
      looked, too, when he discovered what I had done. Then he dragged down all
      the luggage, just as he had done Rose, and tried to put two trunks that
      did not belong to us on the cab, only I raved at him till I obliged him to
      relinquish them. Of course I was forced to offer him a seat in the cab,
      but he coolly replied, &lsquo;No, thank ye; there are too many bandboxes&mdash;the
      squares of their bases occupy the entire area. I&rsquo;ll sit beside cabby.&rsquo; And
      to my horror he scrambled up to the driving-seat, and taking the dirty
      book out of his pocket, was speedily absorbed in its contents; and in this
      state we actually drove up to Lady Lombard&rsquo;s door. I could have beaten the
      man, I was so angry with him. And yet, with it all, the creature is a
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed he is,&rdquo; returned Lewis, &ldquo;a thorough gentleman in mind, though from
      the extent to which he is engrossed by his literary and scientific
      pursuits, and from the fact of living so much alone, he has not the
      manners of society. But Frere is a very first-rate man; his is no ordinary
      intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to watch the play of his features and doubt that for a
      moment,&rdquo; returned Rose eagerly. &ldquo;Look at his speaking eye&mdash;his noble
      forehead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Rose is quite <i>emprise</i> with the monster,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
      Arundel, laughing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a decided case of love at first sight. Was it the
      old greatcoat, or the dreadful hat, which first touched your heart, <i>ma
      chere</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bound to criminate myself,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;so I shall decline to
      answer that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke a short, sharp, double knock, as of an agitated postman,
      awoke the echoes and the porter in Lady Lombard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Marble Hall.&rdquo; In
      another minute the Brobdignagian footman, with prize calves to his legs,
      flung open the drawing-room door and announced, in a stentorian voice,
      &ldquo;Mr. Frere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Quand on parle du diable on en voit la queue?</i>&rdquo; whispered Mrs.
      Arundel, rising quickly. &ldquo;Positively, Rose, my nerves won&rsquo;t stand the
      antics of your pet bear this morning. Let me see you again before you go,
      <i>Louis, mon cher</i>&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find me in the boudoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she glided noiselessly out of one door a moment before Frere
      entered at the other. Lewis followed her retreating figure with a glance
      half-painful, half-amused. &ldquo;My mother grows younger and more gay every
      time I see her,&rdquo; he observed to Rose. A speaking glance was her only
      answer, for at the moment Frere made his appearance&mdash;and a somewhat
      singular one it was. The day being fine, he had discarded the obnoxious
      greatcoat, and&mdash;thanks to his old female domestic, who had caught him
      going out with a large hole in his sleeve and sent him back to put on
      another garment, which she herself selected&mdash;the coat he wore was in
      unusually good preservation, and not so very much too large for him; but
      the heavy shoes, the worsted stockings, the shepherd&rsquo;s plaid trousers, and
      the cotton umbrella were all <i>in statu quo</i>; while his bright eyes,
      sparkling out of a greater bush than ever of untrimmed hair and whiskers,
      gave him a striking resemblance to some honest Scotch terrier, worthy to
      be immortalised by Landseer&rsquo;s pencil. Catching sight of Lewis, he rushed
      towards him, and seizing both his hands (in order to accomplish which act
      of friendship he allowed the umbrella to fall on Rose&rsquo;s toes), he shook
      them heartily, exclaiming, &ldquo;Why, Lewis, old boy! this is a pleasure! I
      hadn&rsquo;t a notion you would be here so soon. How&rsquo;s General Grant? and how&rsquo;s
      Walter? and how&rsquo;s Faust? and how&rsquo;s everybody? Well, I <i>am</i> glad to
      see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time Frere had taken not the slightest notice of Rose, who,
      having advanced a step or two to greet him, had resumed her seat, more
      pleased to witness his delight in welcoming Lewis than any attentions to
      herself could have rendered her. Having seated himself on a sofa and
      pulled Lewis clown by his side, he for the first time appeared aware of
      Rose&rsquo;s presence, which he hastened to acknowledge by a nod, adding, &ldquo;Ah!
      how d&rsquo;ye do? I&rsquo;ve got something to tell you presently, as soon as I&rsquo;ve
      done with your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Lewis, he recommenced his string of questions, without
      regarding Rose&rsquo;s presence otherwise than by occasionally including her in
      the conversation with such interjectional remarks as &ldquo;<i>You</i> can
      understand that&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I explained that to <i>you</i> the other day,&rdquo;
       until at length he abruptly exclaimed, &ldquo;Now I must go and talk to <i>her</i>&mdash;she
      and I have got a little business together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am <i>de trop</i>,&rdquo; observed Lewis with a meaning smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to this Frere merely clenched his fist, and having shaken it
      within an inch of Lewis&rsquo;s face, marched deliberately across the room, and
      drawing a chair close to Rose, seated himself in it; then laying hold of
      one corner of her worsted work, he said in a gruff voice, &ldquo;Put away this
      rubbish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can listen to you, Mr. Frere, and go on with my slipper at the same
      time,&rdquo; returned Rose, quietly releasing her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do two things properly together,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;nobody can;
      for it&rsquo;s all fudge about Cæsar&rsquo;s reading and dictating at the same time.
      What I&rsquo;ve got to tell you is more important than a carpet shoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smiling at his pertinacity, Rose, not having a particle of obstinacy in
      her disposition, put away her work, and demurely crossing her hands before
      her, like a good child saying its lessons, awaited her tyrant&rsquo;s orders.
      That her attitude was not lost upon Frere that gentleman made evident by
      catching Lewis&rsquo;s eye and pointing backwards with his thumb, as much as to
      say, &ldquo;There! do you see that?&rdquo; then producing a note from his pocket, he
      coolly broke the seal, opened it, and handing it to Rose, muttered, &ldquo;Read
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. T. Bracy presents his compliments to Miss Arundel, and begs to
      enclose a note of introduction to Mr. Nonpareil, the publisher, as Mr.
      Frere agrees in thinking that the offer made by Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Street, for the copyright of her interesting
      tale was quite inadequate to its merits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very kind of Mr. Bracy!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose, handing the note to her
      brother, re re having quietly read it over her shoulder. &ldquo;Lewis, I must
      ask you to be good enough to go with me to Mr. Nonpareil&rsquo;s whenever you
      can spare the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble him,&rdquo; returned Frere gruffly; &ldquo;I mean to take you
      there myself; and as there&rsquo;s never any good in putting things off, I vote
      we go this morning. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; replied Rose, smiling; &ldquo;but really, now my brother is
      in town I need not encroach on your valuable time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valuable fiddlestick!&rdquo; was the courteous reply; &ldquo;though, of course,
      everybody&rsquo;s time is valuable, if people did but know how to employ it
      properly&mdash;which they never do. But you don&rsquo;t suppose if I&rsquo;d anything
      very particular in hand I should be dawdling here, do you? I&rsquo;ve got to be
      at the Ornithological at four, and to call at Moore&rsquo;s, the bird-stuffer&rsquo;s,
      first; but I can look in there on our way to Nonpareil&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I&rsquo;m sure Lewis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Rose in a deprecatory tone
      of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense about Lewis!&rdquo; was the surly rejoinder. &ldquo;What do you imagine he
      knows about dealing with publishers?&mdash;they&rsquo;re &lsquo;kittle cattle to shoe
      behint,&rsquo; as a Scotchman would say. I&rsquo;ve had dealings enough with &rsquo;em
      to find out that, I can tell you. As for Lewis, if he were to walk into
      one of their dens with his head up in the air, they&rsquo;d take him for Lord
      Octavo Shallowpate, come to negotiate for another new novel, written with
      a paste-pot and scissors, and when they found he had not a handle to his
      name with which to shove his rubbish down the public throat, they&rsquo;d kick
      him out of the shop again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you really think I look as stupid as a literary lord, eh, Frere?&rdquo;
       inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s too strong a term, perhaps,&rdquo; answered Frere reflectively;
      &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t look like a man of business, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does this sagacious publisher reside?&rdquo; asked Lewis; and when Frere
      had given him the required information, he continued: &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll settle
      the matter thus:&mdash;My tailor, with whom I am anxious to gain an
      interview, lives in the adjoining street; accordingly, I&rsquo;ll walk down with
      Rose and you, and while you negotiate with the autocrat of folios, I&rsquo;ll
      take &lsquo;fitting measures&rsquo; for getting myself &lsquo;neatly bound in cloth.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it then, most facetious youth,&rdquo; returned Frere, laughing; &ldquo;and the
      faster you can get ready, you know,&rdquo; he continued, turning to Rose, &ldquo;the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all obedience,&rdquo; replied Rose, smiling; &ldquo;but I think you&rsquo;re rather
      fond of tyrannising, Mr. Frere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, I?&rdquo; returned Frere in astonishment. &ldquo;Not a bit of it; I&rsquo;m the most
      easily managed fellow in London&mdash;I am, upon my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should see what perfect command his old housekeeper has him in,&rdquo;
       observed Lewis, with an arch glance at his sister; &ldquo;the bear dares not
      growl at her&mdash;she&rsquo;s a perfect Van Amburgh to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now there was so much truth in this charge that it was rather a sore
      subject with Frere. The old woman in question had lived with his mother
      and had nursed him when a child; and for these reasons, as well as from
      good nature and a certain easiness of disposition which lay beneath his
      rough manner, Frere had allowed her gradually to usurp control over him,
      till, in all the minutiae of his domestic life, she ruled him with a rod
      of iron. Although her admiration of and respect for her master&rsquo;s learning
      was fully equal to her total ignorance of the arts and sciences; and
      although her affection for him was boundless, nature had gifted her with a
      crusty temper, which an interval of poverty and hardship (extending from
      the death of Frere&rsquo;s mother till the time when his first act on obtaining
      a competence had been to seek her out and take her into his service) had
      not tended to sweeten. The dialogues which occasionally took place between
      the master and servant were most amusing, and her power over him was
      exercised so openly, that his fear of Jemima had become a standing joke
      among his intimates. Accordingly, on hearing Lewis&rsquo;s observation, Frere
      hastily jumped up and strode to the fireplace, muttering, &ldquo;Nonsense! psha!
      rubbish! don&rsquo;t you believe a word of it, Miss Arundel; but go and dress,
      there&rsquo;s a good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he was going to add &ldquo;fellow&rdquo;; for be it
      known, the clue to his gruff, unpolished behaviour towards the young lady
      in question was to be discovered in the fact, that from her quiet
      composure, freedom from affectation, clear, good sense, and the interest
      she took in subjects usually considered too abstruse for female
      investigation, Frere looked upon her as a kindred soul, and as all his
      other chosen intimates were of the worthier gender, he was continually
      forgetting that she was not a man. Checking himself, however, just in
      time, he substituted &ldquo;creature&rdquo; for &ldquo;fellow&rdquo;; and as Rose left the room,
      he continued, &ldquo; &rsquo;Pon my word, Lewis, your sister&rsquo;s such a nice,
      sensible, well-informed, reasonable being, that I am constantly forgetting
      she&rsquo;s a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which speech shows that amongst your numerous studies that of the female
      character has been neglected,&rdquo; replied Lewis; &ldquo;or that you have taken your
      impressions from very bad specimens of the sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere, who during the above remark had drawn from his pocket a lump of
      crumbling sandstone, which, in order to examine more closely, he coolly
      deposited on a small satin-wood work-table, looked up in surprise as he
      rejoined, &ldquo;Your opinions, touching the merits of womankind, seem to have
      suffered a recovery, young man, seeing that the last time I had the honour
      of discussing the matter with you, women were all perfidious hyaenas, or
      thereabouts. What has wrought so remarkable a transformation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something appeared to have suddenly gone wrong with Lewis&rsquo;s boot, for it
      was not until he had thoroughly investigated the matter that he replied,
      his face being still bent over the offending article, &ldquo;The simple fact
      that as one grows older one grows wiser, I suppose. No doubt Gretchen
      behaved abominably, and rendered me for the time intensely wretched; but
      it was folly in me ever to have placed my happiness in the power of such a
      little, romantic, flirting, half-educated thing as she was; I should not
      do so now, and to argue from such an individual instance, to the
      disparagement of the whole sex, was one of the maddest notions that ever
      entered the brain of a hot-headed boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; whistled Frere in astonishment, &ldquo;you are not over civil to your
      former self, I must say. If anybody else had spoken so disrespectfully of
      you you&rsquo;d have been for punching his head for him; however, I believe your
      present frame of mind is the more sane of the two, though sweeping
      assertions are always more or less untenable. The truth is, you can lay
      down no general rule about it&mdash;women are human as well as men; there
      are a few very good, a few very bad, and an immense number who are nothing
      particular, in both sexes. There is no authority which would lead us to
      suppose Adam&rsquo;s rib was made of ivory more than any of his other bones.
      There&rsquo;s one vice belonging to the fair sex, though&mdash;they&rsquo;re always an
      unmerciful time putting on their bonnets; your sister&rsquo;s been five minutes
      already, and I&rsquo;d lay a bet we don&rsquo;t see her for five more.&rdquo; As he uttered
      the last words, Rose, fully equipped and looking the picture of neatness,
      tripped into the room, to Frere&rsquo;s intense discomfiture, who scrambled his
      relic of the Era of the Old Red Sandstone into his pocket with the air of
      some culprit schoolboy detected in his malpractices by the vigilant eye of
      his pedagogue.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ewis, having
      slipped away for a moment to take leave of Mrs. Arundel, who dismissed him
      with a parting injunction to take care Ursa Major did not devour Rose, the
      trio descended the stairs, Frere taking an opportunity to whisper to
      Lewis, &ldquo;She was down upon me then in every sense of the word; didn&rsquo;t
      believe a woman could get ready in five minutes on any consideration; but
      your sister has more sense than I ever expected to see under a bonnet,

       inquired Lewis, who had imbibed a few Leicesterian prejudices from his
      residence at Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful umbrella! why what&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo; exclaimed Frere, half
      unfurling his favourite; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s-water-tight, and has a famous strong stick
      to it; what more do you want in an umbrella, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might have been made of silk,&rdquo; suggested Lewis mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and be stolen and brought back again regularly three times a week,&rdquo;
       returned Frere. &ldquo;I had a silk one once, and the expense that umbrella was
      to me, to say nothing of the wear and tear of mind it occasioned, was
      perfectly terrific. I shudder when I think of it; there are not a dozen
      cabmen in London who have not received half-a-crown for bringing home that
      umbrella. It was a regular bottle-imp to me, always being lost and always
      coming back again. The &rsquo;bus conductors knew it by sight as well as
      they know the Bank; they were for ever laying traps to get it into their
      possession, with a view to obtain the reward of honesty by bringing it
      home again. I got rid of it at last, though; I lent it to a fellow who
      owed me five pounds, and I&rsquo;ve never seen man, money, or umbrella since.
      Now this dear old cotton thing, not being worth finding, has never been
      lost; however, if you&rsquo;ll promise to take care I have it to-morrow when I
      call, I&rsquo;ll leave it here, and if your sister gets wet don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, will you undertake the heavy responsibility?&rdquo; asked Lewis. &ldquo;I think
      I may safely promise so to do,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;There is a little foot
      page in this establishment in whom I have the greatest confidence, and to
      his custody will! commit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Frere&rsquo;s anxious mind being soothed by this assurance, they started on
      their expedition. Twenty minutes&rsquo; brisk walking&mdash;which would have
      been brisker still if Rose had not gently hinted that ladies were not
      usually accustomed to stride along like postmen; to which suggestion Frere
      responded with something very like a growl,&mdash;twenty minutes&rsquo; walking
      brought them to the very elegant front of Mr. Nonpareil&rsquo;s shop, where
      Lewis left the two others. A nice young man, with Hyperion curls outside
      his head, and nothing save much too high an opinion of himself within, who
      lounged gracefully behind the counter, replied to Frere&rsquo;s inquiry &ldquo;Whether
      Mr. Nonpareil was at home,&rdquo; after the fashion of the famous Irish echo,
      i.e., by another question. Elevating his eyebrows till they almost
      disappeared in his forest of hair, he drawled out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh-a-y? did you w-a-ant him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did, or else I should not have asked for him,&rdquo; returned Frere
      sharply; then handing his own card and Bracy&rsquo;s note of introduction across
      the counter, he continued, &ldquo;Take those to your <i>master</i>, and tell him
      that a lady and gentleman are waiting to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word &ldquo;master&rdquo; Hyperion coloured and appeared about to become
      impertinent, but something in Frere&rsquo;s look induced him to alter his
      intention, and turning on his heel, he strode into the back shop with an
      <i>air martyre</i>, which was deeply affecting to the risible muscles of
      the pair he left behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an animal!&rdquo; exclaimed Frere, as the subject of his remark
      disappeared behind a tall column of account books. &ldquo;Now that ape looks
      upon himself as a sort of Admirable Crichton, and I&rsquo;ll be bound has a
      higher opinion of his own mental endowments than ever Shakespeare or
      Milton had of theirs. I dare say the creature has his admirers, too: some
      subordinate shop boy, or the urchin who runs of errands, takes him at his
      own price and believes in him implicitly. Ye gods, what a &lsquo;ship of fools&rsquo;
      is this goodly vessel of society!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he does not rest his claims on the ground of his personal
      attractions,&rdquo; returned Rose with a quiet smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His strength must lie in his hair, if he does,&rdquo; replied Frere, &ldquo;like that
      of his Israelitish Hercules of old. But see, here he comes, shaking his
      ambrosial locks; and behold, he smiles graciously upon us. Bracy&rsquo;s note
      has worked miracles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Approaching with a smirk and a bow, Hyperion politely signified that Mr.
      Nonpareil was disengaged, then again retreating, led the way through a
      sort of defile of unsold literature to the sanctum of the enterprising
      publisher. This remarkable apartment was of the most minute dimensions, a
      very duodecimo edition of a room, embellished with a miniature fireplace,
      an infinitesimal writing-table, and a mere peep-hole of a window looking
      across many chimney-pots into space. In the middle of this retreat of
      learning, like an oyster in its shell, reposed that Rhadamanthus of
      literature&mdash;the heroic Nonpareil. His outer man was encased in black,
      as became the severity of his office; a white neck-cloth encircled his
      august throat, while a heavy gold watch-chain and seals attested his awful
      respectability. He was of a most respectable age, neither incautiously
      young nor unadvisedly old; he was of a most respectable height, neither
      absurdly short nor inconveniently tall; his weight, 12 stone 6 lbs., was
      most respectable&mdash;it had not varied a pound for the last ten years,
      nor could one look at him without feeling that it would remain exactly the
      same for the next ten years; he had a most respectable complexion, red
      enough to indicate that he lived well and that it agreed with him, but
      nothing more. Nobody could suspect that man of an apoplectic tendency; he
      was much too respectable to think of dying suddenly; the very expression
      of his face was a sort of perpetual life assurance; <i>he</i> go out of
      the world without advertising the day on which he might be expected to
      appear most respectably bound in boards! The idea was preposterous. His
      manner naturally expressed his conviction of his own intense
      respectability, and was impressive, not to say pompous; while from a sense
      of the comparative want of respectability in everybody else it was also
      familiar, or as his enemies (all great men have enemies) declared,
      presuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Rose and Frere entered he stood up to receive them, favoured Frere with
      a salutation half-way between a bow and a nod, partially extended his hand
      to Rose, and as she hesitated in surprise, hastily drew it back again,
      then motioning them to the only two chairs, save his own judgment-seat,
      the apartment contained, resumed his throne, and smiling graciously at
      Rose, leant back, waiting apparently until that young lady should humbly
      prefer her suit to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving his design, Rose glanced appealingly at Frere, who came to her
      assistance by plunging at once in <i>médias res</i> with his accustomed
      bluntness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Nonpareil,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;touching the object of our visit to you,
      I suppose Bracy has told you in his note what we&rsquo;ve come about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is, so far; Mr. Bracy signifies that your visit has a
      business tendency,&rdquo; was the cautious reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we certainly should not have come here for pleasure,&rdquo; returned Frere
      shortly; then catching Rose&rsquo;s look of dismay he continued, &ldquo;I mean to say
      we should not have thought of taking up your valuable time&rdquo; (here he gave
      Rose a confidential nudge with his elbow to indicate that he spoke
      ironically), &ldquo;unless we had a legitimate object in doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer to this the Autocrat merely inclined his head, and revealed a
      highly respectable set of teeth; so Frere resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young lady, Miss Arundel, has determined, by the advice of Mr. Bracy
      and&mdash;ahem!&mdash;myself, to make you the first offer of a very
      valuable work which she has written&mdash;a tale of a very unusual
      description, peculiarly suited, as I consider, to the present state of
      society, pointing out certain social evils, and showing how a more
      consistent adherence to the precepts of Christianity would prove the only
      effectual remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these last words Mr. Nonpareil, who, having apparently lapsed into a
      state of torpor, had listened with a face as immovable as if it had been
      cast in bronze, suddenly pricked up his ears and condescended to exist
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I understand you, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;Frere,&rdquo; suggested that gentleman&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
      Frere,&rdquo; continued Nonpareil, &ldquo;if I comprehend your meaning, sir, this lady
      wishes to dispose of the copyright of a religious novel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my answer must mainly depend on the exact height of the principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the how much?&rdquo; inquired Frere, considerably mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the exact height of the principles, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr. Nonpareil with
      dignity. &ldquo;I possess a regular scale, sir, which I have had worked out
      minutely, proceeding from the broad outlines of Christianity to the most
      delicate shades of doctrine, and descending even to the smallest points of
      the canon law. Such an ecclesiological table is most important in our
      line. Public opinion, sir, fluctuates in such matters, just like the
      funds, up one week, down the next, up again the next. Now I&rsquo;ll just give
      you an instance. There was a little work we published, I dare say you&rsquo;ve
      seen it, &lsquo;Ambrosius; or, The Curate Confessed.&rsquo; It was thought rather a
      heavy book when it first came out. The public would not read it; the trade
      did not like it; it hung on hand, and I expected to lose from £200 to £300
      upon it. Well, sir, the Surplice question began to be agitated.
      Fortunately, the author had made Ambrosius preach in a white gown. I
      immediately advertised it freely, the thing took, we sold 3000 copies in a
      fortnight, and instead of losing £300 I made £600. But that&rsquo;s not all,
      sir. Shortly after that the Rev. Clerestory Lectern, one of the very
      tip-top ones, went to Rome, and took his three curates, a serious butler,
      and the family apothecary with him. This made a great sensation, convulsed
      the public mind fearfully, and brought on a general attack of the
      ultra-protestant epidemic. Accordingly, I sent for the author of
      &lsquo;Ambrosius,&rsquo; offered him terms he was only too glad to jump at, shut him
      up in the back-shop with half a ream of foolscap and a bottle of sherry,
      and in little more than a week we printed off 5000 copies of &lsquo;Loyoliana;
      or, The Jesuit in the Chimney Corner.&rsquo; The book sold like wild-fire, sir.
      A second edition was called for and went off in no time, and I believe I
      might have got through a third, only Lord Dunderhead Downhill joined the
      Plymouth Brethren and married his kitchen-maid, which brought public
      opinion up again several degrees and spoiled the sale; but I made a very
      nice thing of it, altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Mr. Nonpareil rubbed his hand gleefully, pushed his hair off
      his forehead, and looked at Rose as if he longed to coin her into money on
      the spot. After a pause he inquired abruptly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name of my tale?&rdquo; began Rose, slightly flurried at the conversation
      so suddenly taking a personal turn. &ldquo;I thought of calling it &lsquo;Helen
      Tremorne.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very gogd, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;very good,&rdquo; returned Mr. Nonpareil approvingly;
      &ldquo;euphonious, aristocratic, and vague. Just at this time, a title that does
      not pledge a book to anything particular of any kind is most desirable.
      About how long do you suppose it will be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Frere thought it would make two small volumes about the size of a
      work called &lsquo;Amy Herbert,&rsquo; I believe,&rdquo; replied Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, ma&rsquo;am, quite right, a very selling size, indeed,&rdquo; was the
      answer; &ldquo;clever book, &lsquo;Amy Herbert,&rsquo; very. So much tenderness in it,
      ma&rsquo;am; nothing pays better than judicious tenderness; the mothers of
      England like it to read about&mdash;the daughters of England like it&mdash;the
      little girls of England like it&mdash;and so the husbands of England are
      forced to pay for it. If you recollect, ma&rsquo;am, there&rsquo;s a pathetic
      governess in &lsquo;Amy Herbert,&rsquo; who calls the children &lsquo;dearest&rsquo;&mdash;well
      imagined character, that. She&rsquo;s sold many a copy has that governess. May I
      ask does &lsquo;Helen Tremorne&rsquo; call anybody &lsquo;dearest&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really scarcely remember,&rdquo; said Rose, hiding a smile behind her muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be most desirable that she should, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; returned Mr.
      Nonpareil solemnly. &ldquo;Some vindictive pupil, if possible, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;the
      more repulsive the child, the greater the self-sacrifice&mdash;people like
      self-sacrifice to read about&mdash;they call such incidents touching; and
      just at the present moment pathos sells immensely. Pray, ma&rsquo;am, may I ask
      are you high or low?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My principles would not lead me to sympathise with the very ultra party
      on either side,&rdquo; replied Rose, slightly annoyed at being forced to allude
      to such subjects in such a presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the <i>via media</i>; yes, I see&mdash;very good, nothing could be
      better. Just at the present time the via media is, if I may be allowed the
      expression, the way that leads to fortune; nothing sells like it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      so vague and safe, you see; the heads of families buy it in preference to
      any more questionable teaching. May I ask have you fixed on any sum for
      which you would dispose of the copyright of your story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose glanced at Frere, who responded to the appeal by naming a sum exactly
      double the amount which Rose, in her humility, would gladly have accepted.
      She was about to say so, but a slight contraction in her companion&rsquo;s brow
      warned her against committing such an imprudence. Mr. Nonpareil, however,
      did not appear alarmed at the magnitude of the demand, but promising to
      peruse the manuscript carefully (which promise he fulfilled by sending it
      to his paid reader, never even glancing at it himself) and to give a
      definite answer in the course of a few days, he bowed them out of his den
      in the most respectable manner possible. As soon as they had quitted the
      shop, Rose exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, if all publishers are like Mr. Nonpareil, the
      less personal communication I hold with them the better I shall be
      pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but they are not,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;many of them are men of great
      intelligence, simple manners, and who possess much out-of-the-way
      knowledge, which renders them very agreeable companions. There are pompous
      and narrow-minded individuals in all professions. Nothing is more
      illogical than to generalise from a single instance; it&rsquo;s certain to lead
      to the most absurd results. Why, I&rsquo;ve actually encountered an honest
      lawyer and met with a disinterested patriot before now! But here comes
      Lewis; I wonder what conclusion he has arrived at in regard to tailors.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXV.&mdash;HOW RICHARD FRERE OBTAINED A SPECIMEN OF THE &ldquo;PODICEPS
      CORNUTUS.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      * The incident in the following chapter is taken from an anecdote related
      (as the author believes) in &ldquo;Gilpin&rsquo;s Scenery of the New Forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;N</span>ow for the <i>Podiceps
      Cornutus!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Frere, after Lewis had been made acquainted with
      the result of the interview with Mr. Nonpareil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask what wonderful creature rejoices in that ineffable name?&rdquo;
       inquired Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well say &lsquo;wonderful creature,&rsquo;&rdquo; returned Frere, enthusiastically.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief that my precious Podiceps is the first specimen which has
      ever been obtained in this country; and I should fancy it will be the
      last, too, for I don&rsquo;t expect any one will be inclined to take the same
      amount of trouble that I took in order to get it. I was down in
      Lincolnshire last Christmas at a place called Water End&mdash;so named, I
      should imagine, on the <i>lucus a non luceido</i> principle, because there
      was no end of water all round it. Well, sir&rdquo; (he was addressing Rose all
      this time), &ldquo;Fenwick, the man with whom I was staying, told me one day
      that he&rsquo;d seen a bird when he was duck-shooting which he&rsquo;d never met with
      before; and by the description he gave me of it, I felt almost certain it
      must have been a specimen of the Podiceps Cornutus, which, as I dare say
      you know, is scarcely ever found in this latitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse my lamentable ignorance,&rdquo; replied Rose, smiling, &ldquo;but I
      was not even aware of its illustrious existence five minutes ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Frere, arching his eye-brows, &ldquo;they do neglect women&rsquo;s
      educations shamefully, I must say! The <i>Podiceps Cornutus</i> is a
      species of Grebe by no means rare in Pennsylvania, where they winter; in
      summer they migrate to the far countries to rear their young; they are
      web-footed; the bill is&mdash;but, however, you shall see my specimen, so
      I need not bother you with a long description, which I dare say you would
      not understand, after all; and I&rsquo;ll tell you, instead, my adventures in
      pursuit of the particular individual in question. The weather was
      unusually cold, the ground was covered with snow, and the water with ice;
      but as soon as I heard of the <i>Podiceps</i> nothing would serve me but I
      must go after it. Accordingly, an amphibious old animal of a gamekeeper
      was summoned to attend me, and as soon as it was light the next morning
      off we set, and we walked through ice and snow till two o&rsquo;clock in the
      afternoon, each armed with a long duck gun that weighed as much as a young
      cannon. We saw plenty of ducks, teal, and even snipes, but nothing that
      could by any possibility be mistaken for a Podiceps. At last we came to a
      salt-marsh, as they call it,&mdash;that is, a place which is all water
      when the tide is high, and alluvium&mdash;more commonly termed mud&mdash;when
      it&rsquo;s low, which it happened to be at that particular epoch. Well, my old
      companion began to show signs of knocking up, and gave one or two broad
      hints that he considered we were engaged in a wild-goose chase in every
      sense of the term, and that the sooner we relinquished it the better;
      when, all of a sudden, almost from under our feet, up sprang a bird and
      flew away like the wind. &lsquo;The Podiceps, by all that&rsquo;s glorious!&rsquo; exclaimed
      I; and levelling my gun in such excitement that I could scarcely hold it
      steady, I blazed away, and&mdash;of course missed it. The old gamekeeper,
      however, took the thing more coolly&mdash;muttering &lsquo;most haste worst
      speed,&rsquo; he raised his fowling-piece, and when the bird was just at a nice
      killing distance pulled the trigger&mdash;but the confounded gun hung fire
      and did not go off till my Podiceps was all but out of shot. Luckily,
      however, some of the shots reached him, and just as I fancied I was about
      to lose sight of him for ever, he gave a sort of lurch, as if he were
      tipsy, and came toppling down headlong. I marked the spot where he fell,
      and the moment he reached the ground rushed off to secure him. As I was
      going along I heard the old fellow bawling something after me, of which I
      only caught the words, &lsquo;take care,&rsquo; but as I was not in the humour just
      then to take care of anything except to gain possession of my <i>Podiceps</i>,
      I paid no attention to him. The bird had fallen on a sort of
      peninsular-shaped bank, and along this, sometimes over my insteps in mud,
      sometimes up to my knees in water, did I make my way, as fast as the
      difficulties of the path would permit. The spot where the <i>Podiceps</i>
      had fallen proved to be much farther off than I had imagined it, and
      before I reached it I was completely out of breath, and almost dragged to
      pieces by wading through the mud in my heavy boots. However, I cared
      little for that when I discovered the bird lying on his back as dead as
      mutton, and on picking it up perceived that it really was an actual <i>bona
      fide Podiceps Cornutus</i>, and no mere myth, created by my imagination.
      Delighted at having secured my prize, I washed the mud off it, smoothed
      its feathers as carefully as possible, and wrapping it in a handkerchief,
      placed it in my pocket, and prepared to retrace my steps. But, lo and
      behold! while I had been admiring the <i>Podiceps</i>, my peninsula had
      become an island! and there was I, Robinson Crusoe-like, suddenly cut off
      from my fellow-creatures. Not a soul, or more correctly, a body could I
      see,&mdash;my old man had disappeared&mdash;indeed, so altered was the
      face of things by the rising of the water that I did not very well know in
      what quarter to look for him, or in which direction to advance in order to
      gain <i>terra finna</i>, while, to my annoyance, I perceived that my
      island was rapidly growing &lsquo;small by degrees, and beautifully less!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a disagreeable position to be placed in!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose, much
      interested. &ldquo;How <i>did</i> you contrive to escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was just going to tell you if you hadn&rsquo;t interrupted me,&rdquo;
       returned Frere gruffly. &ldquo;I made one or two attempts to discover the route
      by which I had come, but in vain; advance which way I would I only got
      into deeper water, and in the last trial I made I slipped souse into a
      hole, and was half-drowned before I could contrive to scramble out again.
      After this rather serious failure I began to feel that I was in an awkward
      predicament. I shouted, but no one answered, for the very sufficient
      reason that no one was within hearing. I loaded my gun and tried to
      discharge it; but it had become wet when I tumbled into the hole, and
      obstinately refused to go off. The water continued to rise rapidly, and my
      island was already covered, My only hope now lay in the old man; the words
      he had bawled after me must evidently have been a warning against the
      danger in which I had so foolishly involved myself; he was therefore aware
      of my situation, and would surely take some measures for my rescue. At all
      events, there was nothing for it but patience. I was unable to swim, the
      ground on which I stood appeared to be the highest point in the immediate
      vicinity, so there I must remain. Perhaps, after all, my imagination had
      exaggerated the danger; the tide might not rise much higher, and the old
      man, aware of this fact, might be waiting till the waters should recede to
      join me and pilot me safely home. This at all events was a consolatory
      hypothesis, and trying to persuade myself it was the true one, I forced
      the barrel of my gun as deeply into the mud as I was able, leaned my
      elbows on the butt, and thus supported, watched with a beating heart the
      advance of the water. My feet were already covered, and it continued to
      rise almost imperceptibly, and yet, comparing one five minutes with
      another, with appalling rapidity, higher and higher: it gained the calf of
      my leg; it approached, then covered my knees; inch by inch it stole on
      till it reached my hip; the first button of my waistcoat was the next
      point, then the second, then the third, and as that also disappeared I
      felt my situation was indeed becoming perilous in the extreme, and cast my
      eyes around in the vain hope of discovering some means of extricating
      myself. I might have saved myself the trouble; nothing but the still
      increasing water was visible on any side. A slight breeze arose and
      rippled the surface, and now my precaution of thrusting my gun-barrel into
      the mud stood me in good stead; but for it I should have been swept away
      by the advancing tide, and even in spite of this support I found some
      difficulty in preserving my foothold. My eyes seemed riveted by some
      supernatural fascination on the progress made by the deepening water. My
      waistcoat buttoned up to the throat with eight buttons; five of these were
      by this time immersed, the water stood breast high, the sixth disappeared.
      It was with the greatest difficulty I could preserve my balance&mdash;I
      swayed from side to side like a drunken man. The cold was intense; my
      teeth chattered and my limbs were rapidly becoming cramped and paralysed,
      while to add to my catalogue of miseries, the daylight began to fade
      apace. I gave myself up for lost, and came to the conclusion that if ever
      we were fished out the <i>Podiceps</i> and I should be alike candidates
      for a glass-case in some museum. A strange mixture of thoughts ran through
      my brain. I tried to realise the idea of death. I fancied the separation
      of soul and body, and speculated on how my mental self would feel when it
      saw strange fishes taking liberties with my bodily self, without having
      the slightest power to drive them away. My attention was diverted from
      these gloomy fancies by observing that the water appeared much longer in
      reaching my seventh button than it had been in advancing from the fourth
      to the fifth, or from that to the sixth, and while I was casting about to
      find a reason for this variation&mdash;lo and behold! the sixth button
      once more became visible. How was this? Had I unconsciously shifted to
      higher ground, or was it, could it be possible that the tide had turned,
      that the waters had begun to recede? The agonising suspense of the next
      five minutes was one of the most severe mental trials I have ever
      experienced. Though I have spoken lightly on the subject, I had in fact
      made up my mind to face death as a man and a Christian should do, and was
      prepared to meet my fate calmly and resolutely; but now the uncertainty,
      the renewed hope of life struggling with the fear of a possibly
      approaching death became almost unbearable, and had the conflict been
      prolonged my presence of mind would have entirely deserted me. Less than
      five minutes, however, served to set the matter at rest. The sixth button
      was left high and dry, the fifth reappeared, and was succeeded by another
      and another; certain landmarks, whose immersion I had watched with anxious
      eyes, again became visible, and I was thinking of making a final effort to
      reach <i>terra firma</i> before the increasing darkness should throw new
      difficulties in the way, when my ears were greeted by a distant &lsquo;Halloo.&rsquo;
      I shouted in reply, and soon had the satisfaction of perceiving a
      flat-bottomed boat making towards me, propelled by my host and the old man
      who I had conceived basely to have deserted me. As they drew me,
      half-crippled with cold and exhaustion, into the boat, Fenwick began
      haranguing me in a composite strain of upbraiding and condolence, but I
      cut him short by raising my head as I lay sousing in a puddle at the
      bottom of the punt, and murmuring in a faint voice&mdash;&lsquo;Never mind, old
      fellow, it&rsquo;s all right, for <i>I&rsquo;ve got the Podiceps Cornutus</i>.&rsquo; And
      touching that same bird, here we are at the stuffer&rsquo;s shop; so come along
      in, and I&rsquo;ll show him to you bodily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week had elapsed since the morning on which the above conversation took
      place, a week in which many events had occurred. The mighty Nonpareil,
      still considering the <i>via media</i> a promising investment, had
      condescended graciously to purchase Rose&rsquo;s manuscript, and when Frere, who
      brought her the intelligence, placed in her hands a cheque for £100,
      which, relying on her profound ignorance of business forms, he had kindly
      substituted for the publisher&rsquo;s bill at six months, she received it with a
      start of delight. The girl was so happy! she had at length realised her
      darling project; she had, by her own exertions, helped to lighten Lewis&rsquo;s
      burden; she had done something towards shortening his period of
      banishment, for such she considered his enforced residence at Broadhurst.
      Poor Rose! she had not a particle of avarice in her whole nature, and yet
      never did miser rejoice over his hoards as she did over that hundred
      pounds; for it was by no means to be spent&mdash;that, fortunately, was
      unnecessary, as Mrs. Arundel, albeit wanting mental ballast in some
      points, was a notable housewife, and as for Rachel, she was a very dragon
      in her care of that Hesperides, the larder; so that out of the liberal
      allowance Lewis made to them, his mother and sister were privately saving
      a small fund, destined, as they fondly hoped, to advance at some future
      time his fortunes; and to this store Rose&rsquo;s hundred pounds would make a
      magnificent addition. And the joy it was to her thus to dedicate it! Could
      she have purchased with it the most desirable match in England, the hand
      of that identical young duke who was exhibited to correct radical
      tendencies at the electioneering ball at Broadhurst, his Grace might have
      died a bachelor ere Rose would have diverted the money from its appointed
      purpose. But something ought to be done with it. Rose had heard of
      compound interest; nay, she had even had its nature explained to her; and
      though at the end of the explanation she was more in the dark than at the
      beginning, she attributed that to her own obtuseness, and contented
      herself with recollecting that it was something which began by doubling
      itself, and went on doubling itself, and something else, until&mdash;she
      did not know exactly what; so she supplied the blank by adding, until the
      desired result should be attained. And now, recalling the definition thus
      attained, she decided that the advisable thing would be to place her
      hundred pounds in the most favourable situation for catching that
      desirable epidemic, compound interest. Accordingly, with much diffidence,
      and a just appreciation of the very hazy nature of her dissolving views in
      regard to the investment of capital generally, Rose communicated her ideas
      to Frere. That gentleman heard her out with a good-humoured smile playing
      around the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, as she concluded, &ldquo;you
      are but a woman after all, I see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what have you taken me for hitherto, then?&rdquo; demanded Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      This very pertinent inquiry appeared somewhat to puzzle the individual to
      whom it was addressed, for he pushed his hair back from his forehead and
      rubbed his chin with an air of perplexity ere he answered, &ldquo;If I were what
      they call a lady&rsquo;s man, which means a conceited puppy, I should grin at
      you to show my white teeth, and reply, &lsquo;An Angel;&rsquo; but seeing that <i>man</i>
      was made a little lower than the angels&mdash;though, by the way, that&rsquo;s a
      mistranslation&mdash;and that women are inferior to men, to call a woman
      an angel is to be guilty of a logical absurdity, and is only to be excused
      in the case of lovers, who, as men labouring under a mental delusion&mdash;temporary
      monomaniacs, in fact&mdash;are scarcely to be looked upon as rational
      beings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you are not a puppy, and I am not an angel, both which
      propositions I am perfectly ready to admit, why do you consider it
      necessary to enunciate your apparent discovery that, after all, I am <i>only</i>
      a woman?&rdquo; inquired Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if you must know,&rdquo; growled Frere, at length fairly brought to
      bay, &ldquo;you have hitherto talked so much sense, and so little nonsense, that
      I&rsquo;ve looked upon you more as a man than a woman. You wanted the truth, and
      now you&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; he continued in a tone like the rumbling of distant
      thunder, as Rose, clapping her hands in girl-like delight at having
      elicited this confession, replied with a low, silvery laugh, &ldquo;I thought
      so! I fancied that was it! Oh, the conceit of these lords of the creation!
      And now that you have found out that I am not the mental Amazon your fancy
      painted me, do you intend <i>quite</i> to give me up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she said this, half playfully, half in earnest, raising her calm, grey
      eyes, which now sparkled with unwonted animation, to his face, Frere
      experienced a (to him) entirely new sensation. He was for the first time
      conscious of the effect produced by
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      &ldquo;The light that lies
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      In woman&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and he felt&mdash;unreasonable as he could not but consider it&mdash;that
      he was better pleased with Rose as she was than if she had been Professor
      Faraday himself; than whom (barring Sir Isaac Newton) Frere&rsquo;s mind was
      incapable of conceiving a more exalted type of male humanity. The way in
      which he expressed the gentle sentiment which had stolen into his breast
      was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk such rubbish, but listen to a little common sense, and try and
      comprehend it, if you can, for once in your life. You want this money
      invested for Lewis&rsquo;s benefit, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Receiving a reply in the
      affirmative, he continued, &ldquo;Well, then, have you sufficient confidence in
      me to trust it entirely in my hands to invest as I think best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be indeed ungrateful if I had not,&rdquo; returned Rose, the tears
      springing to her eyes, as she remembered Frere&rsquo;s many acts of kindness to
      her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psha! stuff! I didn&rsquo;t mean anything of that kind,&rdquo; rejoined Frere,
      provoked with himself for having recalled such distressing recollections,
      &ldquo;only you women are so ready to trust anybody till you&rsquo;ve been let in for
      it two or three times, and then you&rsquo;re just as unreasonable the other way,
      and suspect every one whether they deserve it or not; however, as I
      believe I&rsquo;m indifferent honest, I&rsquo;ll take this money, if you wish it, and
      do the best I can with it. Lewis shall not be always a tutor if we can
      help it, though it&rsquo;s wonderful how contented he&rsquo;s grown lately&mdash;so as
      he lashed out too when he was first put in harness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve observed the change, have you, Mr. Frere?&rdquo; returned Rose
      interrogatively. &ldquo;I have been rejoicing in it exceedingly; it is just what
      I could have wished, but dared not hope for. I attribute it in great
      measure to his affection for poor Walter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it may be so; no doubt the lad presents an interesting
      psychological study,&rdquo; returned Frere reflectively, &ldquo;though I rather
      conceive it may be owing to his having taken a liking to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Grant and Miss Livingstone,&rdquo; vociferated the Colossus of plush,
      flinging open the door with a startling vehemence, the result of an
      ebullition of temper consequent upon a severe rebuke he had just received
      from Minerva for mispronouncing her patronymic, which interruption
      prevented Frere from expressing his innocent conviction that certain
      geological researches in the neighbourhood of Broadhurst constituted the
      charm that had so suddenly reconciled Lewis to his dependent position.

      introduced herself to Rose with that easy courtesy which adds so great a
      charm to the manners of a perfectly well-bred woman, and Rose, as she
      gazed on her, thought she had never beheld anything so lovely before. She
      was dressed in&mdash;<i>Halt là!</i> attention, young ladies! <i>favete</i>&mdash;no,
      <i>not linguis</i>; in the amiability of your natures you are always ready
      enough to do that&mdash;-<i>favete auribus</i>, listen and learn; for I
      myself, the chronicler of this veritable history, am about to vindicate
      the good use I made of those halcyon days when

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and to prove that &ldquo;follies&rdquo; were not <i>all</i> they taught me&mdash;for
      this I assert and am prepared to maintain, that good taste in dress is not
      in itself a folly, and only becomes so when the mind of a fool (or fool-<i>ess</i>
      as the case may be) exalts it to an undue pre-eminence. Annie, be it
      remembered, was a <i>blonde</i>, with just enough of the rose in her
      cheeks to prevent the lily from producing an appearance of ill health. The
      month was June, the London season was at its height, and the young lady
      had called upon Rose in her way to the second horticultural fête at
      Chiswick Gardens. Her bonnet was of white chip, from which a small white
      ostrich feather tipped with blue drooped lovingly, as though it sought to
      kiss the fair face beneath it. A <i>visite</i> of light <i>blue glacé</i>
      silk had been fashioned by the skill of an ingenious Parisian <i>modiste</i>,
      so as to suggest rather than conceal the exquisite form it covered,
      beneath which the rich folds of a gown of pale fawn-colour <i>Gros de
      Naples</i>, as uncreased as if, cherub-like, its wearer never sat down,
      completed the costume; and a very becoming one it was, as we feel sure all
      young ladies of good taste will allow. Richard Frere, being slightly
      acquainted with Minerva Livingstone, good-naturedly devoted himself to
      that indurated specimen of the original granite formation, who from her
      name and nature might possibly possess a geological interest in his eyes,
      and by trying to macadamise her into small-talk, enabled the two girls to
      prosecute their acquaintance undisturbed. Rose, little used to society,
      was shy and reserved before strangers, though there was a quiet
      self-possession about her which prevented her manner from appearing <i>gauche</i>
      or unformed. Annie, on the other hand, being in the constant habit of
      receiving and entertaining guests, made conversation with a graceful ease
      which completely fascinated her companion The only subject on which her
      fluency appeared to desert her was when she spoke of Lewis, his kindness
      to Walter, and the valuable services he had lately rendered her father;
      but the little she did say showed so much good taste and evinced such
      genuine warmth of heart and delicacy of feeling, that his sister was more
      than satisfied, and settled in her own mind that if all the family were as
      charming in their different ways as was Miss Grant in hers, Lewis&rsquo;s
      contentment with his present situation was no longer to be wondered at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely, fascinating creature!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose enthusiastically, as
      the door closed on her visitors; &ldquo;she is like some bright vision of a
      poet&rsquo;s dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems a cute, hard-headed old lady, but she struck me as having
      rather too much vinegar in her composition to induce one to covet much of
      her society; olives are well enough in their way, but a man would not
      exactly wish to dine upon them, either,&rdquo; returned Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who on earth are you talking about?&rdquo; inquired Rose in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who should I be talking about, except Miss Livingstone?&rdquo; returned
      Frere gruffly. &ldquo;Have you &lsquo;gone stupid&rsquo; all of a sudden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> must have become blind,&rdquo; retorted Rose, &ldquo;not to have observed
      Miss Grant&rsquo;s unusual grace and beauty; I wonder Lewis has never said more
      about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; growled Frere, &ldquo;do you think your brother has nothing better to do
      than to chatter about a woman&rsquo;s pretty face? Lewis is, or was (for his
      opinions on the subject seem to have been modified lately), a confirmed
      misogynist, and I&rsquo;m very glad of it. Nothing makes me more savage than to
      hear the confounded puppies of the present day talk about this &lsquo;doosed
      fine woman&rsquo; or that &lsquo;uncommon nice gal.&rsquo; If I happened to have a sister or
      any other womankind belonging to me, and they were to make free with her
      name in that fashion, I should pretty soon astonish some of their
      exquisite delicacies. Well,&rdquo; he continued, buttoning up his coat all awry,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off, so goodbye;&rdquo; and taking Rose&rsquo;s hand in his own, he wrung it with
      such force that a flush of pain overspread her pale features. Observing
      this, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Did I squeeze your fingers too hard? Well, I am a
      bear, as Lewis says, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo; As he spoke he laid her hand in his
      own broad palm, and stroking it gently, as though trying to soothe an
      injured child, he continued, &ldquo;Poor little thing, I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt
      it;&rdquo; then looking innocently surprised as Rose somewhat hastily withdrew
      it, he added, &ldquo;What! isn&rsquo;t that right either? well, I see I&rsquo;d better be
      off. I&rsquo;ll look you up again in a day or two, and if you want me you know
      where to find me.&rdquo; So saying, he clattered downstairs, put on his hat
      hind-side before, and strode off, walking at the rate of at least five
      miles an hour. As he passed the church in Langham Place he overtook two
      gentlemen engaged in earnest conversation: regardless of this he quickened
      his pace and struck the younger of the two a smart blow on the back,
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Bracy, my boy, how are you?&rdquo; The individual thus roughly
      saluted immediately reeled forward as if from the effects of the blow, and
      encountering in his headlong career an elderly female, whose dress bespoke
      her an upper servant or thereabouts, he seized her by the elbows and
      twirled her round in the bewildering maze of an impromptu and turbulent
      waltz, which he continued till an opportune lamp-post interposed and
      checked his Terpsichorean performance. Before his astonished partner had
      recovered breath and presence of mind sufficient to pour forth the first
      words of a tide of angry remonstrance, Bracy interposed by exclaiming in a
      tone of the most bland civility&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam, excuse this apparent liberty; really I am so completely
      overpowered that I would sink into the ground at your feet if it were not
      for the granite pavement which is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Which is,&rdquo; continued Bracy, louder and with still deeper <i>empressement</i>,
      &ldquo;as you justly observe, so very hard; but, my dear madam, the facts of
      this case are yet harder. Let me assure you my offence, if you choose to
      stigmatise my late lamented indiscretion by so harsh a name, was perfectly
      involuntary; simply an effect produced by a too vehement demonstration of
      fraternal feeling on the part of my particular friend Mr. Frere. Allow me

      Swan observes, &lsquo;Fair encounter of two most rare affections!&rsquo; or again,
      &lsquo;Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all wery fine,&rdquo; exclaimed the outraged one (suddenly finding
      her tongue), &ldquo;to go frightening of respectible parties out of their wits,
      and then think to smooth &rsquo;em over with your blarneying words; but
      if I could set eyes on one of them lazy pelisemen which is never to be
      found when wanted, blessed if I wouldn&rsquo;t give you in charge for your
      imperence, so I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the delivery of this speech Bracy had listened in an exaggerated
      theatrical attitude of entranced attention, and at its conclusion he
      exclaimed, in a voice so intensely impassioned that it would have ensured
      his success at any of the minor theatres&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Oh! speak again; let mine enraptured ear
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Drink the sweet accents of thy silvery voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Which sentiment procured for him the applause of a small male spectator of
      the tender age of ten years, clad in much dirt and a pair of adult
      trousers on their last legs in every sense of the term, who expressed his
      approval by nodding complacently and remarking, &ldquo;Wery well done; ancore, I
      says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; exclaimed Frere, seizing Bracy&rsquo;s arm and almost forcing him
      away; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have a crowd round you directly. Your companion has taken
      himself off long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he has,&rdquo; returned Bracy, looking round. &ldquo;Now I call that mean, to
      desert a friend in difficulties; more especially,&rdquo; he added, as they
      walked away together, &ldquo;as the said difficulties were undertaken wholly and
      solely on his account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his account?&rdquo; returned Frere in surprise; &ldquo;why, I should have thought
      the mighty De Grandeville was the last person likely to appreciate a
      street row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which reason I never lose an opportunity of involving him in one,&rdquo;
       replied Bracy, rubbing his hands with mischievous glee. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t bear
      walking with me, for I always get him into some scrape or other, and
      injure his dignity irreparably for the time being. Why, the last severe
      frost we had I met him in Pall Mall, drew him on to talk of architecture,
      pointed out to him a mistake which didn&rsquo;t exist in the front of one of the
      club-houses, and while he was looking up at it beguiled him on to a slide
      and upset him, quite inadvertently, into an itinerant orange basket, just
      as Lady B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, with whom he has a bowing
      acquaintance, was passing in her carriage. Look at him now, prancing along
      as if all Regent Street belonged to him! Walk a little faster, and we
      shall overtake him; and, by the way, lend me that wonderful cotton
      umbrella of yours; I&rsquo;ll make him carry it right down to the Home Office.
      You are bound for Westminster, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you guess that?&rdquo; asked Frere, handing him the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s a meeting at the Palaeontological to-day at three, and I
      know you&rsquo;re one of their great guns,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief that you know everything about everybody,&rdquo; returned Frere,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know everything about every-<i>thing</i>&rdquo; rejoined Bracy, &ldquo;so
      between us we form an epitome of human knowledge. I say, De Grandeville,&rdquo;
       he continued, as they overtook that gentleman, &ldquo;you are a treacherous
      ally, to desert your comrade in the moment of danger. That ferocious old
      woman abused me within an inch of my life, and wanted to give me in charge
      to a policeman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowing you have an equal aptitude for getting into and out of scrapes of
      that nature,&rdquo; returned De Grandeville, &ldquo;I&mdash;ar&mdash;considered you
      fully equal to the situation&mdash;and&mdash;ar&mdash;having no taste for
      bandying slang with vituperative plebeian females, I left you to fight
      your own battles. Was I not justified in doing so, Mr. Frere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Bracy being the aggressor, I suppose you were,&rdquo; was the answer;
      &ldquo;but as I was the innocent first cause of the scrimmage I felt bound to
      remain, and dragged Bracy away by main force, just in time, as I imagine,
      to save him from the nails of the insulted matron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! what a nuisance. I do believe I&rsquo;ve broken my trouser strap,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Bracy, stopping and elevating his boot on a doorstep. &ldquo;Hold this
      one moment while I try to repair damages, there&rsquo;s a good fellow,&rdquo; he
      continued, thrusting the umbrella into De Grande-ville&rsquo;s unwilling hand;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you again directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The damages must have been serious, judging by the length of time they
      took to remedy; for ere Bracy rejoined them, Frere and De Grandeville had
      proceeded half the length of Regent Street, the latter carrying the
      umbrella&mdash;which he regarded from time to time with looks of the most
      intense disgust&mdash;so as to keep it as much out of sight as possible,
      even secreting it behind him whenever he perceived a fashionably dressed
      man or woman approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was trying to recollect that very interesting anecdote you told me of
      the attack on the barrack in Galway when you were staying with the 73rd&mdash;Frere
      has never heard of it,&rdquo; observed Bracy as he rejoined his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this said anecdote related to an episode in De Grandeville&rsquo;s career to
      which he delighted to refer, and which, accordingly, most of those who
      boasted the honour of his acquaintance had heard more than once.. Such
      indeed was the case with Frere, and he was just going to say so when he
      caught a warning look from Bracy, which induced him to remain silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;really, it was a very simple thing,&rdquo; began De Grandeville,
      falling into the trap most unsuspiciously. &ldquo;I happened to know several of
      the 73rd fellows who were quartered down in Galway at a place called&mdash;ar&mdash;here&rsquo;s
      your umbrella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon! I did not quite catch the name,&rdquo; returned Bracy, who,
      having buried his fingers in the pockets of his paletot, did not seem to
      have such a thing as a hand about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a place called Druminabog,&rdquo; continued De Grandeville. &ldquo;The country was
      in a very disturbed state; one or two attacks of a rather serious
      character had been made upon the police, and the military had been called
      out to support them; ar&mdash;here&rsquo;s your um&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it three or four years ago that all this took place?&rdquo; inquired the
      still handless Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four years on the second of last April,&rdquo; returned De Grandeville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it wasn&rsquo;t the first?&rdquo; muttered Frere aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was travelling on a business tour in the sister island,&rdquo; continued the
      narrator, &ldquo;and meeting Osborne, a 73rd man, who was going down to join his
      regiment, he persuaded me to come on with him to Druminabog&mdash;ar&mdash;here&rsquo;s
      your&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that Tom Osborne, who sold out when the rifles were going to Ceylon?&rdquo;
       interposed Bracy, studiously ignoring the proffered umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victimised De Grandeville replied in the affirmative, and resuming his
      tale, soon grew so deeply interested in the recital of his own heroic
      exploits that the umbrella ceased any longer to afflict him; nay, so
      absorbed did he become, that in a moment of excitement, just as he was
      passing the Horse Guards, he waved that article in the air and led on an
      imaginary company of the 73rd therewith, after the fashion of gallant
      commanders in panoramas of Waterloo, and battle scenes enacted at the
      amphitheatre of Astley. As they approached the Home Office, and De
      Grandeville had arrived at the concluding sentence of his narrative, which
      ran as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;And so, sir, the Major shook me warmly by the hand,
      exclaiming, &lsquo;De Grandeville, you&rsquo;re worthy to be one of us, and I only
      wish you were, my boy!&rsquo;&rdquo; the trio paused, and Bracy extracting one hand
      from the pocket in which it had been reposing, remarked, with the air of a
      man who considered himself slightly aggrieved but meant to make the best
      of it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if you please, I&rsquo;ll trouble you for my umbrella; I did not like to
      interrupt your story by asking for it sooner, but now, if you have no
      objection, I shall be glad of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied De Grandeville, only too glad (his attention being
      once more attracted to it) to get rid of his incubus.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Frere turned aside to hide a laugh, Bracy inquired, &ldquo;By the way, De
      Grandeville, do you dine at Lady Lombard&rsquo;s next Tuesday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> do,&rdquo; replied Frere; &ldquo;and I suppose it&rsquo;s to be one of her Lord
      Mayor&rsquo;s feasts, as I hear she&rsquo;s beating up recruits in all quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;really&mdash;I&rsquo;ve received an invitation&mdash;but I&mdash;ar&mdash;
      &rsquo;pon my word, I don&rsquo;t know whether one&rsquo;s justified in going to such
      places; one must draw the line&mdash;ar&mdash;somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a first-rate feed,&rdquo; resumed Bracy. &ldquo;Lady Lombard&rsquo;s <i>chef</i>
      is a capital hand, and her wine is by no means to be despised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the woman herself,&rdquo; rejoined De Grandeville in a tone of the
      deepest disgust, &ldquo;just retrace her degrading career&mdash;ar&mdash;not an
      ancestor to begin the world with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should have supposed she possessed her fair share in Adam and
      Noah, too,&rdquo; remarked Frere drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plebeian in origin,&rdquo; continued De Grandeville, not heeding the
      interruption, &ldquo;she sinks herself still lower by espousing first a
      pickle-merchant, secondly a pawnbroker; the first&mdash;ar&mdash;repulsive,
      the second sordid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not play her cards altogether badly, though,&rdquo; observed Bracy.
      &ldquo;Old Girkin died worth a plum, and Sir Pinchbeck Lombard was a
      millionaire, or thereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money, sir,&rdquo; returned De Grandeville sententiously, &ldquo;is by no means to be
      despised, and those who affect indifference on the subject usually do so
      to screen a grasping and avaricious temperament. But money becomes really
      respectable only when it enables those who are connected with the old
      historical families of England, those in whose veins runs the &lsquo;blue&rsquo; blood
      of aristocracy, to assert their rightful position as lords of the soil.
      Among the landed gentry of England are to be found&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some thoroughly jolly fellows,&rdquo; interposed Bracy, &ldquo;especially to show you
      the way across country, or help to kick up a shindy at the Coal Hole. But
      we must part company here; Frere&rsquo;s booked for the Palaeontological, and I
      am going to attend a Committee at the House You&rsquo;ll be at Lady Lombard&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall give the matter full consideration,&rdquo; returned De Grande-ville.
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;ar&mdash;by no means a step to decide on hastily. In these
      levelling days men of&mdash;ar&mdash;position are forced to be particular
      as to the places to which they afford the&mdash;ar&mdash;sanction of their
      presence. I wish you a very good morning;&rdquo; so saying, he raised his hat
      slightly to Frere, drew himself up with his broad chest well thrown
      forward, and marched off majestically like a concentrated squadron of
      heavy dragoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your umbrella, Frere,&rdquo; remarked Bracy, handing it to him as he
      spoke; &ldquo;many thanks for the loan. I don&rsquo;t wonder you are careful of it;
      it&rsquo;s a most inestimable property, and has afforded me half-an-hour&rsquo;s deep
      and tranquil enjoyment. But of all the pompous fools that ever walked this
      earth Grandeville is <i>facile princeps</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no fool either,&rdquo; returned Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why does he behave as <i>sich?</i>&rdquo; demanded Bracy. &ldquo;His conceit and
      egotism are inconceivable. He&rsquo;s a regular modern Cyclops; he has one great
      &lsquo;I&rsquo; in the middle of his forehead, through the medium of which he looks at
      everything. One really feels an obligation to poke fun at that man. Well,
      I can&rsquo;t accuse myself of neglect of duty in that particular, that&rsquo;s a
      consolatory reflection; but he&rsquo;s enough to convert the slowest old
      anchorite that ever chewed peas into a practical joker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was severe on the excellent Lady Lombard,&rdquo; observed his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not notice his remark about riches being respectable only when in
      the possession of &lsquo;&mdash;ar&mdash;those connected with the old historical
      families of England&rsquo;? That gave me a new idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thing always worth having, if but from its rarity,&rdquo; replied Frere.
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it occurred to me what fun it would be to marry him to Lady Lombard&mdash;more
      particularly after his abuse of her to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A project more easy to conceive than to execute,&rdquo; returned Frere,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; answered Bracy confidently; &ldquo;if I once set my mind on
      a thing, I generally contrive to accomplish it. It did not at first sight
      appear likely that De Grandeville would carry your old cotton umbrella
      through some of the most fashionable streets in London at three o&rsquo;clock in
      the afternoon, yet you see he did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a remarkable man, my dear Bracy, and I have the greatest faith in
      your powers of management, but if you can induce Marmaduke de Grandeville
      to marry the widow of the pawnbroker and the pickle-man, you must be the
      very&mdash;well, never mind who&mdash;here we are at the
      Palaeontological.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Frere shook hands with Bracy, and the oddly consorted
      companions, between whom their very eccentricities appeared to constitute
      a bond of sympathy, each went his way, the practical joker to apply his
      acute intellect to the details of that mighty machine, the executive
      government of England, and the <i>savant</i> to investigate the recently
      discovered small rib (it was only eight feet long) of a peculiar species
      of something-osaurus, the original proprietor of the rib being popularly
      supposed to have &ldquo;lived and loved,&rdquo; cut its awful teeth, and been gathered
      to its amphibious fossil forefathers two thousand years and some odd
      months before the creation of man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII.&mdash;WHEREIN IS FAITHFULLY DEPICTED THE CONSTANCY OF THE
      TURTLE-DOVE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the
      important Thursday on which Lady Lombard&rsquo;s chief dinner-party of the
      season was to take place, and the mighty coming event cast a proportionate
      shadow before. For a day or two previous a gloom, as of an approaching
      tempest, hung over the devoted mansion. Visitors were scarce; the invited
      would not call because they <i>were</i> invited, and the non-invited
      avoided the place as though it were plague-stricken, lest it should be
      supposed they wished to be invited, which for the most part they did. As
      the event drew nearer signs appeared heralding its approach: shoals of
      fishmongers, laden with the treasures of the deep, poured down the area
      steps; the number of oysters which entered that house would have surprised
      Neptune himself; squadrons of poulterers&rsquo; men brought flocks of feathered
      fowls, and of fowls unfeathered; there was not a single species of edible
      ornithology of which Lady Lombard did not possess one or more specimens&mdash;she
      would have ordered a <i>Podiceps Cornutus</i> had she ever heard of such a
      creature. The eighty-guinea advertisement-horse, with the plated harness,
      in Messrs. Fortnum &amp; Mason&rsquo;s spring cart, began to think his masters
      must have established a depot in the far west, and that he was engaged in
      transporting thither the major portion of their seductive stock. In the
      interior of that dwelling-house confusion reigned supreme. Upstairs Mrs.
      Perquisite, the housekeeper, rendered life a burden to the female
      servants, and tyrannised over her hapless mistress till free will became a
      mockery mentioned in connection with that ever-thwarted widow. It was
      enough for Lady Lombard to express a wish; Mrs. Perquisite, a living
      embodiment of the antagonistic principle, was instantly in arms to oppose
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, your ladyship!&rdquo; would she exclaim (and be it observed, her voice
      was at least an octave higher than any good-tempered woman&rsquo;s ever was, and
      pitched in a most aggravating key); &ldquo;what! not uncover the marble table! I
      never heard of such a thing! Her Ladyship <i>will</i> have it taken off,
      Jane&mdash;not uncover that bootiful Paria marble! inlaid with Lappuss
      Lazily. Why, your Ladyship must be a-dreaming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that the satin cover matching the chairs, and having poor dear
      Sir Pinchbeck&rsquo;s arms embroidered on it, perhaps it might have been better
      to leave it on, Mrs. Perquisite,&rdquo; pleaded Lady Lombard meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course your Ladyship can do as your Ladyship pleases; if your Ladyship
      likes to demean yourself by looking after such things, which was never the
      case when I lived with the Dowager Marchioness of Doubledutch, now no
      more, having remembered all her faithful servants handsomely on her
      death-bed, without a dry eye about her, in the seventy-sixth year of her
      age. Perhaps I had better go downstairs, which is only in the way, and
      your Ladyship can direct Jane to set out the rooms according to your
      Ladyship&rsquo;s fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lady Lombard, when once that defunct Dowager Marchioness was let
      loose upon her, felt that her fate was sealed. It was not for her, the
      widow of a man who had been knighted, to fly in the face of the peerage;
      so she humbly authorised the removal of the Lombard arms, implored
      Perquisite to arrange the rooms as she had been accustomed to set out
      those of the poor dear Marchioness, and betook herself to the sanctity of
      her own boudoir, leaving the field to the virago, to whom she paid £60 per
      annum for keeping her in a continual state of moral bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while such scenes as the foregoing were enacting in the upper portions
      of the establishment, the French <i>chef de cuisine</i>, Monsieur Hector
      Achille Ulisse Abelard d&rsquo;Haricots, was making a perfect Pandemonium of the
      lower regions. The physical energy displayed by that accomplished
      foreigner was truly admirable, his ubiquity was marvellous; the tassel at
      the top of his white night-cap appeared to have been multiplied
      infinitesimally and to pervade space, the sound of his polyglot
      exhortations and reflections re-echoed through the lofty servants&rsquo;
      offices. Wonderful were the strange oaths he poured forth, when Antoine, a
      long, limp, shambling French lad, &ldquo;<i>son élève</i>, zie son of&mdash;<i>hélas!
      baigné des larmes</i>, he even till at present scarcely could pronounce
      her name&mdash;his angelic sister, since some time entombed, having
      espoused <i>un brave Anglais</i>, his long-lost Louise Amélie
      Marie-Antoinette de Brownsmit, née d&rsquo;Haricots,&rdquo;&mdash;when this unworthy
      offspring of international alliance committed some unpardonable artistic
      error, and unlike &ldquo;Polly&rdquo; of lyrical celebrity, did <i>not</i> &ldquo;put the
      kettle on,&rdquo; or &ldquo;take it off again,&rdquo; exactly at the critical moment. Deep
      and nasal were his ejaculations when some obtuse butcher&rsquo;s boy would not
      understand his &ldquo;Anglishe,&rdquo; which that somewhat apocryphal personage, &ldquo;<i>ce
      brave garçon</i> Brownsmit&rdquo; (who was Hector Achille&rsquo;s Mrs. Harris, and was
      consequently brought forward on all occasions), had declared he spoke like
      a native.
    </p>

      &ldquo;<i>Mais, que diable!</i> vot is zies?&rdquo; he would exclaim, raising his
      eyeglass to examine with a face of deep disgust a shin of beef; &ldquo;vot is
      zies? Did I not ordaire <i>un gigot</i>, vot you call a leg of ship, and
      &rsquo;ere you &rsquo;ave transported to me&mdash;<i>ah, que c&rsquo;est
      dégoutant!</i>&mdash;zie stump of a cow: <i>qu&rsquo;ils sont bêtes, ces Anglais</i>&mdash;takes
      &rsquo;im avay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But if there were earthquakes and tornadoes in the culinary and decorative
      departments, difficulties hydra-headed had arisen in the boudoir of Lady
      Lombard, where sat a council of three, Rose merely acting as secretary and
      writing just what she was bidden. The third privy councillor (besides the
      giver of the feast and Mrs. Arundel) was a certain Mrs. Colonel Brahmin,
      relict of the late Colonel Brahmin, which gallant officer had been cut off
      in the prime of life, together with 200 tawny privates of the&mdash;&mdash;th
      native infantry, by falling into an ambush of armed Sikhs, headed by Meer
      Ikan Chopimatoo at Choakumcurree. After this afflicting event Mrs. Colonel
      Brahmin returned to England, in the thirty-third year of her age, with a
      small pension, a very becoming widow&rsquo;s cap, and an earnest desire to
      replace the victim of Ikan Chopimatoo&rsquo;s scimitar without loss of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in bygone hours the lamented Sir Pinchbeck Lombard, in his capacity
      of East India director, had known and patronised the lamented Brahmin;
      what, therefore, could be more natural than that their disconsolate widows
      should desire to mingle their tears? And, indeed, Mrs. Colonel Brahmin was
      so anxious to ensure the effectual working of this Mutual-misery-mingling
      Association, that on her return to England she was good enough to stay six
      months with Lady Lombard; and although, during the whole of that period,
      she told every one she was anxiously looking out for a house, so few
      edifices are there in London and its vicinity, that she was unable to find
      one till the very week before her hostess was about to start on a
      self-defensive tour to the Lakes. Since then she had been vizier-in-chief
      to her wealthy sister in affliction, riding in her carriage, eating her
      dinners, and entertaining her guests, especially such eligible males as
      appeared likely to succeed to the (nominal) command left vacant by the
      cut-off colonel; but up to the present time these young eligibles had
      remained unattached, and the appointment was still to be filled up. Mrs.
      Brahmin was not really pretty, though, by dint of a pair of fine eyes,
      glossy hair, a telling smile, and little white hands, she contrived to
      pass as such. In her manner she affected the youthful and innocent; and
      very well she did it, considering her natural astuteness, and the amount
      of experience and <i>savoir vivre</i> she had acquired when following the
      world-wide fortunes of the cut-off one. Lady Lombard believed in her to a
      great extent, and liked her better than she deserved. Perquisite saw at a
      glance, not only through, but considerably <i>beyond</i> her, and hated
      her with all the rancour of a vulgar mind. But Mrs. Brahmin was too strong
      for Perquisite, and with her soft voice and imperturbable simplicity put
      her down more thoroughly than the veriest virago could have done&mdash;the
      housekeeper&rsquo;s most bitter speeches and cutting innuendos producing much
      the same effect on the mild Susanna that a blow might have done upon an
      air-cushion&mdash;viz., exhausting the aggressor&rsquo;s strength without making
      the slightest impression on her opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brahmin had been prepared to find in Mrs. Arundel a dangerous rival,
      and was ready to defend her position to the death, and to battle <i>à
      l&rsquo;outrance</i> for her portion of the Lombard loaves and fishes. But her
      courage was not destined to be put to the proof, the present being an
      occasion on which an appeal to arms was unnecessary&mdash;diplomacy would
      suit her purpose better, and on diplomacy, therefore, she fell back. She
      had not been ten minutes in Mrs. Arundel&rsquo;s company ere she discovered her
      weak point&mdash;she was unmistakably vain. Accordingly, with artless
      simplicity, Mrs. Brahmin indirectly praised everything Mrs. Arundel said
      or did, and Mrs. Arundel straightway suffered her discrimination to be
      tickled to sleep, took Mrs. Brahmin at her own price, and doted on her
      from that time forth, until&mdash;but we will leave events to develop
      themselves in their due course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Mrs. Brahmin were mutual enigmas&mdash;neither could comprehend
      the other. Rose had heard the details of the &ldquo;Chopimatoo&rdquo; affair, and all
      her sympathies were ready to be enlisted in behalf of the interesting
      widow; but the &ldquo;sweet simplicity,&rdquo; cleverly as it was done, did not
      deceive her. With the instinct of a true nature she felt that it was
      assumed, and that beneath it lay the real character. What that might be
      remained to be discovered, and she suspended her judgment till opportunity
      might afford her a glimpse of that which was so studiously concealed. On
      the other hand, the character of Rose was one which Mrs. Brahmin could by
      no means comprehend, perhaps because in its entireness it was beyond and
      above her comprehension; but parts of it she discerned clearly enough, and
      most particularly did they puzzle her. For instance, she perceived that
      Rose had a mind, properly so called&mdash;that her ideas and opinions were
      <i>bona fide</i> the product of her own intellect, and not like those of
      too many girls, a dim reflex of somebody else&rsquo;s; but the straightforward,
      earnest truthfulness of her nature she could by no means fathom, such a
      quality being essentially foreign to her own disposition; accordingly, she
      deemed it put on for a purpose, which purpose it behoved her to find out.
      But her investigations did not prosper well, from the simple fact that <i>ex
      nihilo nil fit</i>: Rose, having nothing to conceal, concealed it
      effectually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many and important were the consultations held in the boudoir by this
      council of three, as to who should, and who should not, be invited. Lady
      Lombard&rsquo;s smooth brow grew furrowed with the unwonted demand upon her
      powers (?) of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Benjamin and Lady Boucher regret exceedingly that a previous
      engagement prevents their accepting Lady Lombard&rsquo;s kind invitation for
      Thursday, the&mdash;th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, how <i>dreadfully</i> provoking!&rdquo; sighed the perplexed
      &ldquo;in-vitress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Susanna&rdquo; (the Brahmin&rsquo;s Christian name), &ldquo;the Bouchers are
      engaged, and there&rsquo;ll be nobody fit to meet the General Gudgeons. What are
      we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you ask the Dackerels? They&rsquo;re such very nice people, and live in
      such very good style, dear Lady Lombard,&rdquo; cooed Mrs. Brahmin (for, be it
      observed, that bereaved one&rsquo;s method of speaking, together with the low,
      gentle, sleepy, caressing tones of her soft voice, involuntarily reminded
      her hearers of the cooing of a dove or the purring of a cat).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only lieutenant-colonels, are they, my love?&rdquo; inquired Lady
      Lombard doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear Lady Lombard, surely you must recollect he has been a full
      colonel, by purchase, these five years, <i>vice</i> Rawbone Featherbed,
      who sold out and married an heiress&mdash;at least,&rdquo; murmured Innocence,
      remembering herself, or rather her <i>part</i>, &ldquo;she was said to be very
      rich; but of course it must have been a love-match. I cannot believe
      people are so&mdash;so horrid as to marry from any other motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;d better ask the Dackerels. Miss Arundel, my love, will
      you request the pleasure of Colonel and Mrs. Dackerel&rsquo;s company&mdash;with
      one R, my dear&mdash;at seven o&rsquo;clock. That shy son with the long legs, I
      suppose we need not ask him, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lately come into a large Yorkshire property from an uncle on the
      mother&rsquo;s side and has taken the surname of Dace, and perhaps, as he&rsquo;s so
      shy, he might feel hurt at not being asked. I feel such sympathy with
      shyness, you know; besides, somebody said he was an author,&rdquo; rejoined
      Susanna, dropping her eyelids and looking as unconscious and disinterested
      as if John Dace Dackerel Dace, Esq., barrister-at-law, still depended upon
      that ghost of nothing, his professional income, instead of the rent-roll
      of the manor of Roachpool, in the West Riding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they come they&rsquo;ll make&mdash;let me see,&rdquo; mused Lady Lombard; &ldquo;what
      did I say the Fitzsimmons&rsquo;s were? Yes, twelve; well, then, they&rsquo;ll make
      fifteen, and the table only holds three more, and that tiresome Mr. De
      Grandeville hasn&rsquo;t sent an answer yet, and I shall be so disappointed if
      he does not come, for he knows everybody and moves in such high society,
      and is such a tall, noble, military-looking creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This eulogium recalling, probably by contrast (seeing that the lamented
      Brahmin had been remarkably small of his age all through his boyhood, and
      never outgrown it afterwards), sad recollections of the fair Susanna&rsquo;s
      killed and wounded, produced a little embroidered handkerchief which just
      held the two tears its owner felt called upon to shed on such occasions.
      The memory of the victim had, however, been so often before embalmed by
      pearly drops in her presence that Lady Lombard had grown rather callous on
      the subject, and she abruptly invaded the sanctity of grief by exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It lies between the Lombard Browns and the Horace Hiccirys, my dear. The
      Hiccirys live in better style, I know: Mrs. Hicciry was to have been
      presented at Court last year, only little Curatius chose to be born
      instead&mdash;the most lovely child! But the Lombard Browns are godsons,
      at least <i>he</i> is, of poor dear Sir Pinchbeck&rsquo;s, and they&rsquo;ve not dined
      here this season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, dear Lady Lombard, if I might venture to advise, the Horace
      Hiccirys would do best. Mrs. General Gudgeon would get on so well with
      Mrs. Hicciry, I&rsquo;m sure; and I&rsquo;m afraid Mrs. Dackerel,&mdash;you know she&rsquo;s
      very clever, writes poetry, those sweet things in the Bijou&mdash;all
      clever people are sarcastic, you know,&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid Mrs. Dackerel
      might laugh at poor dear Mr. Lombard Brown&rsquo;s little eccentricity about his
      H&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; returned Lady Lombard; &ldquo;yes, I forgot his H&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he probably does himself,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Arundel aside to Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear Miss Arundel, may I trouble you to write a note to the
      Horace Hicciry&rsquo;s&mdash;with two I&rsquo;s, my love&mdash;15 Bellairs Terrace,
      Park Village West. What a pretty hand you write, and so quick I Then if
      Mr. De Grandeville will only come, the table will be filled properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a dear, charming party it will be,&rdquo; cooed the bereaved one, who had
      manoeuvred herself into an invitation at an early stage of the
      proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my love, I hope it will,&rdquo; replied the giver of the feast anxiously.
      &ldquo;And if I was quite sure that Perquisite and Haricot would not quarrel,
      and that General Gudgeon would not take too much port wine after dinner,
      and tell his gentlemen&rsquo;s stories to the ladies up in the drawing-room,
      more particularly since I hear Miss MacSalvo has taken an extra serious
      turn lately, I should feel quite happy about it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better add a postscript to the great Gudgeon&rsquo;s note mentioning the
      port wine and its alarming consequences, Rose,&rdquo; whispered the incorrigible
      Mrs. Arundel. Her daughter smiled reprovingly, and the sitting concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly at the time when Lady Lombard had completely given him up, and was
      revolving in her anxious mind how she might best supply his loss, De
      Grandeville condescended graciously to vouchsafe a favourable answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the eventful day, as Frere was returning from his
      place of business, he met&mdash;of course accidentally&mdash;Tom Bracy,
      who immediately took possession of his vacant arm and engaged him in a
      disquisition on the use of formic acid as an anaesthetic agent, which
      discussion proved so deeply interesting to his companion, that in less
      than five minutes he was completely lost to all outward objects and
      reduced (for all practical purposes) to the intellectual level of a docile
      child of three years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Frere eagerly, as Bracy paused before a hairdresser&rsquo;s
      shop, &ldquo;well, supposing, for the sake of argument, I consent to waive my
      objection; supposing I allow that by the process you describe you&rsquo;ve
      produced your acid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my interrupting you one moment, but I was going in here to have my
      hair cut. If you&rsquo;re not in a particular hurry, perhaps you&rsquo;ll come in with
      me, and I think I can show you where you are wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m not in a hurry; come along, I&rsquo;m convinced there&rsquo;s a
      mistake in your theory which upsets your whole argument&mdash;merely
      subject to the common analysing process&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; observed Bracy carelessly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be all the better for a
      little judicious trimming yourself; besides, it&rsquo;s more sociable. This
      gentleman and I each want our hair cut. Sit down, Frere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? nonsense; I never have my hair cut except when the hot weather sets
      in,&rdquo; remonstrated that individual; but he was fairly in the toils. Bracy
      set a garrulous hairdresser&rsquo;s man at him, who deprived him of his hat,
      popped him down in the appointed chair, and enveloped him in a
      blue-striped wrapper before he very well knew where he was, or had arrived
      at any kind of decision whatsoever on the subject. No sooner was he seated
      than Bracy administered a fresh dose of his anaesthetic agent; Frere
      resumed his argument, and long ere he had exhausted the catalogue of
      chemical tests to which his opponent&rsquo;s theory (invented for the occasion)
      might be subjected, the hair-cutter (previously instructed) had reduced
      his hair and whiskers to the latitude and longitude usually assigned to
      such capillary attractions by the &ldquo;manners and customs of ye English in ye
      nineteenth century.&rdquo; And thus Frere became, for the time being, a
      reasonable looking mortal, and Bracy won a new hat, which he had betted
      that morning with a mutual acquaintance, on the apparently rash
      speculation that he would before the day was over administer an
      anaesthetic agent to Richard Frere, under the influence of which he should
      have his hair cut.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII.&mdash;DESCRIBES THE HUMOURS OF A LONDON DINNER-PARTY IN
      THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ear Rose Arundel
      (excuse us the adjective, kind reader, for we frankly own to being very
      fond of her), having been a perfect godsend to everybody during the whole
      morning of the party day, having thought of everything and done
      everything, and looked on the bright side of everything, and sacrificed
      herself so pleasantly that an uninitiated beholder might have imagined her
      intensely selfish and doing it all for her own personal gratification,&mdash;Rose
      having, amongst other gymnastics of self-devotion, run up and down stairs
      forty-three times in pursuit of waifs and strays from Lady Lombard&rsquo;s
      memory, committed the first bit of selfishness of which she had been
      guilty all day, by sitting down to rest for five minutes before she began
      her toilet; and leaning her forehead on her hand, thought over her own
      chances of pleasure or amusement during the evening. She had had one
      disappointment: Lewis had been invited, and Lewis would not come. He did
      not say he could not come, but he put on what Mrs. Arundel called his
      &ldquo;iron-face,&rdquo; and said shortly, &ldquo;the thing was impossible;&rdquo; and no one
      could have looked on his compressed lips and doubted the truth of the
      assertion. It grieved Rose, for she read his soul as it were an open book
      before her, and she saw there pride, that curse of noble minds, still
      unsubdued. Lady Lombard patronised them, and Lewis could not submit to
      witness it. Rose had hoped better things than this; she had not failed to
      observe the change that had taken place in her brother during his
      residence at Broadhurst; she saw that from an ardent, impetuous boy he had
      become an earnest-minded, high-souled man, and in the calm dignity of his
      look and bearing she recognised the evidence of conscious power, chastened
      by the discipline of a mind great enough to rule itself. Nor was she wrong
      in her conjectures; only she mistook a part for the whole, and arguing
      with the gentle sophistry of a woman&rsquo;s loving heart, concluded that to be
      finished which was but in fact begun. Lewis had learned to <i>control</i>
      (except in rare instances) his haughty nature, but he relied too much on
      his own strength, and so he had failed as yet to subdue it. Rose was too
      honest to disguise the truth from herself when it was fairly placed before
      her, and she acknowledged, with an aching heart that the great fault of
      her brother&rsquo;s character yet remained unconquered. Poor Rose! as this
      conviction forced itself upon her, how she sorrowed over it. He was so
      good, so noble, and she loved him so entirely&mdash;oh! why was he not
      perfect? If Lewis could have read her thoughts at that moment he would
      have assuredly made one of the guests at Lady Lombard&rsquo;s hospitable board.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock struck the half-hour, forming the <i>juste milieu</i> between
      seven and eight, post meridiem, the goodly company assembled in Lady
      Lombard&rsquo;s drawing-room, being warned by the portly butler that dinner was
      served, paired off and betook themselves two by two (like the animals
      coming out of Noah&rsquo;s Ark, as represented on the dissecting puzzles of
      childhood) to the lofty dining-room, where much English good cheer,
      disguised under absurd French names, awaited them. During the short time
      that Bracy had been in the house he had not been altogether idle. He first
      took an opportunity of informing Lady Lombard that De Grandeville was
      directly descended from Charlemagne, and that he was only waiting till the
      death of an opulent relative should render him independent of his
      profession to revive a dormant peerage, when it was generally supposed his
      colossal intellect and unparalleled legal acumen would render him
      political leader of the House of Lords; he then congratulated her on her
      good fortune in having secured the presence of this illustrious
      individual, who, he assured her, was in such request amongst the
      aristocracy of the kingdom that he was scarcely ever to be found
      disengaged, and wound up by running glibly through a long list of noble
      names with whom he declared the mighty Marmaduke to be hand and glove.
      Accordingly, good Lady Lombard, believing it all faithfully, mentally
      elected De Grandeville to the post of honour at her right hand, deposing
      for the purpose no less a personage than General Gudgeon. When we say no
      less a personage, we speak advisedly, for that gallant officer, weighing
      sixteen stone without his snuff-box, and being fully six feet high, was,
      if not exactly &ldquo;a Triton amongst minnows,&rdquo; at all events a Goliath amongst
      gudgeons, which we conceive to be much the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having achieved his object of placing De Grandeville in exactly the
      position he wished him to occupy, Bracy next proceeded to frustrate a
      scheme which he perceived the fair Susanna (who was his pet antipathy) to
      have originated for the amatory subjugation and matrimonial acquisition of
      John Dace Dackerel Dace, Esq., of Roachpool, in the West Riding. The
      aforesaid John D. D. had a weakness bordering indeed on a mental
      hallucination; he fancied he was born to be a popular author&mdash;&ldquo;to go
      down to posterity upon the tongues of men,&rdquo; as he himself was wont to
      express it&mdash;and the way in which he attempted to fulfil his exalted
      destiny and effect the wished-for transit, <i>viâ</i> these unruly members
      of his fellow-mortals, was by writing mild, dull articles, signed J. D.
      D., and sending them to the editors of various magazines, by whom they
      were always unhesitatingly rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frequent repetition of these most unkind rebuffs, and the consequent
      delay in the fulfilment of his mission, had tended to depress the spirit
      (at no time an intensely ardent one) of John Dace Dackerel, and had
      induced a morbid habit of mind, through which, as through a yellow veil,
      he took a jaundiced view of society at large; and even the acquisition of
      the surname of Dace, and his accession to the glories of Roachpool, had
      scarcely sufficed to restore cheerfulness to this victim of a postponed
      destiny. Bracy, from his connection with Blunt&rsquo;s Magazine, knew him well,
      and had rejected, only a fortnight since, a forlorn little paper entitled
      &ldquo;The Curse of Genius, or the Trammelled Soul&rsquo;s Remonstrance;&rdquo; in which his
      own cruel position was touchingly shadowed forth in the weakest possible
      English. Accosting this son of sorrow in a confidential tone of voice,
      Bracy began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you can spare a minute to listen to me, I&rsquo;ve something rather
      particular to tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell me?&rdquo; returned the blighted barrister in a hollow voice,
      suggestive of any amount of black crape hatbands. &ldquo;What ill news have I
      now to arm, or I may say, to steel my soul against?&rdquo; And here be it
      observed that it was a habit with this pseudo-author to talk, as it were,
      a rough copy of conversation, which he from time to time corrected by the
      substitution of some word or phrase which he conceived to be an
      improvement upon the original text.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it may be good news instead of bad!&rdquo; remarked Bracy
      encouragingly. The blighted one shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for <i>me</i>&rdquo; he murmured; then turning to Susanna, he continued,
      &ldquo;Excuse my interrupting our conversation, but this gentleman has some
      intelligence to impart&mdash;or I may say, to break to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brahmin smiled sweetly such a sympathetic smile that it went straight
      through a black satin waistcoat, with a cypress wreath embroidered on it
      in sad-coloured silk, and reached the &ldquo;crushed and withered&rdquo; heart of J.
      D. D. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; continued Bracy, &ldquo;I was obliged, most unwillingly, to decline
      that touching little thing of yours. The&mdash;what is it? the Cough of
      Genius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Curse,&rdquo; suggested its author gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes. I read it cough&mdash;you don&rsquo;t write very clearly&mdash;yes, *
      the Cursing Genius.&rsquo; You know, my dear Dace, we editors are placed in a
      very trying position. A great responsibility devolves upon us; we are
      scarcely free agents. Now your article affected me deeply&rdquo; (this was
      strictly true, for he had laughed over the most tragic touches till the
      tears ran down his cheeks), &ldquo;but I was forced to decline it. I could not
      have put it in if my own brother had written it. You will naturally ask,
      Why? <i>Because it did not suit the tone of Blunt&rsquo;s Magazine!</i>&rdquo; And as
      Bracy pronounced these awful and mysterious words he shook his head and
      looked unutterable things; while the &ldquo;child of a postponed destiny,&rdquo;
       seeing the shadow of a still further postponement clouding his dark
      horizon, shook his head likewise, and relieved his elaborately-worked
      shirt-front of a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed Bracy, &ldquo;thinking the paper much too original to be lost, I
      took the liberty of handing it over to Bullbait, the Editor of the Olla
      Podrida. Well, sir, I saw him this morning, and he said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed the fated one eagerly, a hectic tinge colouring his
      sallow cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t excite yourself, my dear Dace,&rdquo; rejoined Bracy anxiously; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      looking pale: too much brain work, I&rsquo;m afraid. You must take care of
      yourself; so many of our greatest geniuses have died young. But I see
      you&rsquo;re impatient. Bullbait said&mdash;he&rsquo;s a very close, cautious
      character, never likes to commit himself, but he actually said, <i>he&rsquo;d
      think about it!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; groaned the disappointed Dace, relapsing into despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All! my dear sir? all! Why, what would you have? When a man like Bullbait
      says he&rsquo;ll think about a thing, I consider it a case of <i>opus operatum</i>&mdash;reckon
      the deed done. If he meant to refuse your paper, what need has he to think
      about it? No, Mr. Dace, if you&rsquo;re not correcting a proof of the &lsquo;Cough&rsquo;&mdash;psha,
      &lsquo;Curse,&rsquo; I mean&mdash;(when one once takes a wrong idea into one&rsquo;s head
      how difficult it is to get it out again!) before the week is over, I&rsquo;m no
      prophet. By the way,&rdquo; he continued, as Rose, looking better than pretty in
      the whitest of muslin frocks, resigned a comfortable seat to a cross old
      lady in a gaudy turban, which gave her the appearance, from the neck
      upwards, of a plain male Turk, liberally endowed with the attributes
      commonly assigned to his nation by writers of fairytales and other light
      literature for the nursery, amongst which man-stealing and cannibalism are
      two of the least atrocious&mdash;&ldquo;by the way, I must introduce you to this
      young lady; a kindred soul, sir, one of the most rising authoresses of the
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I really&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the Dace, flapping about in the
      extremity of his shyness like one of his fishy namesakes abstracted from
      its native element.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; resumed Bracy, enjoying his embarrassment. &ldquo;Miss Arundel, let
      me have the pleasure of making you acquainted with one of our men of
      genius, a writer to whom a liberal posterity will no doubt do justice,
      however the trammelled sycophants of a clique may combine to delay his
      intellectual triumphs.&rdquo; Then in an aside to J. D. D. he added, &ldquo;Make play
      with her; Bullbait wants her particularly to write for the Olla, and she
      hangs back at present: she would merely have to say a word to him, and you
      might obtain the run of the magazine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus urged, John Dace, Dackerel Dace, Esq., called up all the energies of
      his nature, and by their assistance overcoming his habitual sheepishness,
      he caused to descend upon Rose a torrent of pathetic small-talk which
      overwhelmed that young lady till dinner was announced, when he claimed her
      arm and floated with her down the stream of descending humanity until he
      found himself safely moored by her side at the dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bracy having thus, as he would himself have expressed it, taken the change
      out of that odd fish Dace, and frustrated, for the time being, the
      matrimonial tactics of the Brahmin&rsquo;s widow, was making his way through the
      various groups of people in search of Miss MacSalvo, whose rampant
      Protestantism might, he considered, afford him some sport if judiciously
      handled, when he was suddenly intercepted by the innocent Susanna with the
      inquiry, &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Bracy, can you explain this wonderful metamorphosis in
      your friend Mr. Frere? He&rsquo;s grown quite handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, Bracy regarded attentively the individual in question,
      who was good-naturedly turning over a book of prints for Lady Gudgeon, a
      little shrivelled old lady, so deaf as to render conversation with her a
      pursuit of politeness under difficulties. Having apparently satisfied
      himself by this investigation, Bracy replied, &ldquo;To the best of my belief, I
      should say he had only had his hair cut, and was for once dressed like a
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is wonderfully clever, is he not?&rdquo; inquired the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever!&rdquo; repeated Bracy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mild word to apply to such
      acquirements as Frere rejoices in. He knows all the languages, living or
      dead; possesses an intimate acquaintance with the arts and sciences, has
      all the &lsquo;ologies&rsquo; at his fingers&rsquo; ends, and is not only well up in the
      history of man since the creation, but will tell you to a fraction how
      many feeds a day kept a Mastodon in good condition two or three thousand
      years before we tailless monkeys came into possession of our landed
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, as he dresses so strangely in general, that he&rsquo;s very poor:
      all clever people are, I believe,&rdquo; returned Susanna, with an air of the
      most artless <i>naïveté</i>, the idea having for the first time occurred
      to her that, <i>faute de mieux</i>, the philosopher might do to replace
      the man of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bracy read her thoughts, and kindly invented a few facts and figures by
      which he increased Frere&rsquo;s income about sevenfold, and gave him a
      magnificent stock of expectations, regarding the realisation whereof not
      the most forlorn hope ever existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done this small piece of mischief also, he continued his search
      after Miss MacSalvo. The result of these machinations was that Lady
      Lombard signified to De Grandeville that he was to hand her down to
      dinner; John Dace Dackerel Dace, Esquire, performed the same office by
      Rose, much to the disgust of Richard Frere, who had intended to secure
      that pleasure for himself, and who being, at the moment in which he first
      became aware of his misfortune, captured by the Brahminical widow, whose
      silky manner he could not endure, went downstairs in a frame of mind
      anything but seraphic. Mrs. Arundel contrived to gain possession of
      General Gudgeon, with a view, as she observed to Bracy, to discover,
      firstly, his system of feeding, which, from its results, she felt sure
      must be an excellent one; and secondly, to ensure his obtaining a liberal
      supply of port wine, to the end that she might satisfy a reprehensible
      curiosity as to the precise nature of the &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s stories&rdquo; Lady
      Lombard was so anxious to suppress; which act of un-<i>English</i>-woman-like
      <i>espièglerie</i> must be set down to the score of a foreign education,
      than which we know not a better receipt for unsexing the minds of the
      daughters of Albion. When we add that Bracy, with a face of prim decorum,
      escorted Miss MacSalvo, a gaunt female, whose spirit appeared to have
      warred with her flesh so effectually that there was little more than skin
      and bone left, we believe we have accounted for every member of the party
      in whom our readers are likely to feel the slightest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the era of the fish and soup, by which our modern dinners are
      invariably commenced, little is discussed except the viands; but after the
      first glass of sherry mute lips begin to unclose, and conversation flows
      more freely. Thus it came about that John Dace Dackerel Dace, Esquire, of
      the Inner Temple (we admire his name so much that we lose no opportunity
      of repeating it), having revolved in his anxious mind some fitting speech
      wherewith to accost the talented young authoress, of whom he felt no
      inconsiderable degree of dread, fortified himself with an additional sip
      of sherry ere he propounded the very original inquiry, &ldquo;Whether Miss
      Arundel was fond of poetry?&rdquo; Before Rose could answer this query her
      neighbour on the other side, one Mr. James Rasper, a very strong young man
      with a broad, good-natured, dullish face, demanded abruptly, in a jovial
      tone of voice, &ldquo;Whether she was fond of riding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she could collect her senses, scattered by the raking fire of
      this cross-examination, Rose replied &ldquo;that she was particularly fond of
      some kinds of poetry,&rdquo; which admission she qualified by the apparently
      inapposite restriction&mdash;&ldquo;When she was on a very quiet horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      J. D. D. was about to follow up his attack by a leading question in regard
      to the gushing pathos of the bard of Rydal, when Rasper prevented him by
      exclaiming, &ldquo;No! Do you really?&rdquo; (which he called &ldquo;railly&rdquo;). &ldquo;Then I know
      just the animal that would suit you.&rdquo; And having thus mounted his
      hobby-horse he dashed at everything, as was his wont when once fairly off,
      and rattled away, without stopping, till dinner was finished, and he had
      talked Rose completely stupid; while the unfortunate Dace, foiled in his
      weak attempt to captivate the influential authoress, plunged again into
      the deep waters of affliction, where, pondering over this further
      postponement of his destiny, he sank, and was heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly opposite to Rose and her companions sat Frere and the simple
      Susanna, who, labouring zealously at her vocation&mdash;viz.,
      husband-hunting&mdash;threw away much flattery and wasted an incalculable
      amount of &ldquo;sweetness on the desert air.&rdquo; To all her pretty speeches Frere
      returned monosyllabic replies in a tone of voice suggestive of whole
      forests full of bears with sore heads, while a cloud hung heavy on his
      brow, and his bright eyes flashed envy, hatred, malice, and all
      uncharitableness at the unconscious James Rasper. At last Susanna chanced
      to inquire whether he were fond of music; and as, without falsifying
      facts, he could not answer this negatively, he was forced to reply, &ldquo;Yes;
      I like some sort of music well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some sort only,&rdquo; returned Susanna in a tone of infantine artlessness.
      &ldquo;Oh! you should like every kind, Mr. Frere. I never hear a merry tune
      without longing to dance to it, and pathetic music affects me even to
      tears. But what class of music is it that you particularly prefer?&mdash;though
      I need scarcely ask&mdash;operatic, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; growled Frere; &ldquo;I hate your operas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Frere!&rdquo; exclaimed Simplicity, fixing its large eyes reproachfully
      upon him, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t mean what you say. Not like operas! Why, they are
      perfectly delicious. Look at a well-filled house&mdash;what a magnificent
      <i>coup d&rsquo;oil!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A set of pigeon-holes full of fools, and a long row of fiddlers,&rdquo;
       rejoined Frere; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I see much to admire in that. I went to one
      of your operas last year, and a rare waste of time I thought it. It was
      one of Walter Scott&rsquo;s Scotch stories bewitched into Italian. There was
      poor Lucy of Lammermoor dressed out like a fashionable drawing-room belle,
      singing duets all about love and murder with a pale-faced, moustachioed
      puppy, as much like Edgar Ravenswood as I am like the Belvidere Apollo&mdash;a
      brute engaged, on the strength of a tenor voice, to make love to all and
      sundry for the space of four calendar months, for which &lsquo;labour of love&rsquo;
      he is paid to the tune of £500 a month, a salary on which better men than
      himself contrive to live for a whole year. Then Lucy&rsquo;s cruel mamma, who is
      the great feature in the novel, was metamorphosed into a rascally brother,
      who growled baritone atrocities into the ears of a sympathising chorus of
      indigent needle-women and assistant carpenters, who act the nobility and
      gentry of Scotland at half-a-crown a head and their beer. The first act is
      all love and leave-taking, the second all cursing and confusion, and the
      third all madness and misery: and that&rsquo;s what people call a pleasant
      evening&rsquo;s amusement. The only thing that amused me was in the last scene,
      when the stipendiary lover kills himself first and sings a long scena
      afterwards. I thought that very praiseworthy and persevering of him, and
      if I&rsquo;d been Lucy such a little attention as that would have touched me
      particularly, and I dare say it would have done her, only&mdash;seeing
      that she had died raving mad some five minutes before, and was then
      drinking bottled porter in her dressing-room for the good of her voice&mdash;she
      was perhaps scarcely in a situation to appreciate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t like the singing, I dare say you prefer the ballet?&rdquo;
       suggested Susanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the short, sharp, and decisive reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not like the ballet? Oh! Mr. Frere, what can be your reason?&rdquo; inquired
      the surprised turtle-dove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have a reason good and sufficient, but I shan&rsquo;t tell it to you,&rdquo;
       growled Frere; then muttered as an aside, which was, however, sufficiently
      audible, &ldquo;A set of jumping Jezebels skipping about in white muslin kilts,
      for they&rsquo;re nothing better; respectable people ought to be ashamed of
      looking at &rsquo;em.&rdquo; Having enunciated this opinion, Frere cast a
      doubly ferocious glance at Mr. Rasper, then eloquently describing to Rose
      the points of his favourite hunter, and relapsed into surly monosyllables,
      beyond which no amount of cooing could again tempt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marmaduke de Grandeville, enthroned in state on the right hand of the lady
      of the house, gazed regally around him, and in the plenitude of his
      magnificence was wonderful to behold. But, after all, he <i>was</i> human,
      and the evident depth and reality of Lady Lombard&rsquo;s admiration and respect
      softened even him, so that ere long he graciously condescended to eat,
      drink and talk&mdash;not like an ordinary mortal, for that he never did,
      but like himself. For instance, the topic under discussion being the new
      Houses of Parliament, then in even a more unfinished state than they are
      at present, De Grandcville elaborately explained the whole design, every
      detail of which he appeared to have at his fingers&rsquo; ends&mdash;a fact for
      which he accounted when he allowed it to be understood that&mdash;&ldquo;Ar&mdash;he
      had&mdash;ar&mdash;given Barry a hint or two&mdash;ar&mdash;that Barry was
      a very sensible fellow, and not above&mdash;ar&mdash;acting upon an idea
      when he saw it to be a good one;&rdquo; and it must be owned that as De
      Grandeville had only once been in Mr. Barry&rsquo;s company, on which occasion
      he had sat opposite to him at a public dinner, he had made the best use of
      his time, and not suffered his powers of penetration to rust for want of
      use. Having in imagination put the finishing-stroke to the Victoria Tower
      (one of the furthest stretches of fancy on record, we should conceive), he
      contrived to work the conversation round to military matters, set General
      Gudgeon right on several points referring to battles in the Peninsula at
      which the General had himself been present, and gave so graphic an account
      of Waterloo, that to this day Lady Lombard believes he acted as Amateur
      Aide-du-Camp and Privy Counsellor-in-Chief to the Duke of Wellington on
      that memorable occasion. He then talked about the De Grandeville estates
      till every one present believed him to be an immense landed proprietor,
      and wound up by the anecdote of William of Normandy and the original De
      Grandeville, which, with a slight biographical sketch of certain later
      worthies of the family (one of whom, Sir Solomon de Grandeville, he
      declared to have suggested to King Charles the advisability of hiding in
      the oak), lasted till the ladies quitted the room, when, by Lady Lombard&rsquo;s
      request, he assumed her vacant chair, and did the honours with dignified
      courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bracy, who during dinner had appeared most devoted to Miss MacSalvo, now
      endeavoured to render himself universally agreeable. He applauded General
      Gudgeon&rsquo;s stories, and plied him vigorously with port wine, which, as Mrs.
      Arundel had taken care the servants did not neglect to replenish his
      wine-glass at dinner, began to tell upon him visibly. He elicited the
      names, pedigrees, and performances of all Mr. James Rasper&rsquo;s horses, and
      received from that fast young man a confidential statement of his last
      year&rsquo;s betting account, together with a minute detail of how he had
      executed that singular horticultural operation yclept &ldquo;hedging on the
      Oaks,&rdquo; during which dry recital his throat required constantly moistening
      with wine, in spite of which precaution his voice grew exceedingly thick
      and husky before the sitting concluded. On two individuals of the party,
      however, all Bracy&rsquo;s efforts were thrown away: Frere continued silent and
      moody, only opening his lips occasionally, shortly and sternly to
      contradict some assertion, and relapsing into his former taciturnity;
      while J. D. D. sat silently bewailing his postponed destiny over a glass
      of water and two ratafia cakes, which seemed to possess the singular
      property of never diminishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the gentlemen rose to go upstairs, a matter easily accomplished
      by every one but General Gudgeon, who made three unsuccessful attempts to
      get under weigh, and then looked helplessly round for assistance. Bracy,
      the ever-ready, was at hand in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear General, let me lend you an arm. You&rsquo;re cramped from sitting so
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha-a-ank you, my dear bo-o-oy,&rdquo; returned the gallant officer, who
      appeared to have been seized with a sudden, wild determination to alter
      the English language by dividing monosyllables into three parts, and
      otherwise fancifully to embellish his mother-tongue. &ldquo;Tha-a-ank you! It&rsquo;s
      that confou-wow-wow-nded gun-shot wound in my knee-ee. I got it at
      Bu-Bu-Bu&mdash;no! not Bucellas. What is it, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busaco,&rdquo; suggested Bracy, fearing he had over-dosed his patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when once the General got upon his legs he used them to better
      advantage than might have been expected, and proceeded upstairs, &ldquo;rolling
      grand,&rdquo; as that prince of clever-simple biographers (to adopt one of Mrs.
      Browning&rsquo;s double-barrelled adjectives), Boswell, said of his ponderous
      idol. Encountering Frere at the foot of the staircase, he stumbled against
      that gentleman with so much force as nearly to knock him down. As he
      recovered his footing Frere turned angrily towards his assailant; but his
      irritation changed to an expression of contemptuous pity as his eye fell
      upon the white hair of General Gudgeon, and stepping on one side, he
      allowed him to pass. He was quietly following, when Mr. James Rasper, who
      had witnessed his discomfiture with an ill-bred laugh, excited by the wine
      he had drank, attempted, by way of a stupid practical joke, to repeat
      General Gudgeon&rsquo;s involuntary assault, and reckoning Frere a good-natured,
      quiet sort of person, not likely to resent such a jest, pretended to
      stumble against him, and pushed past him when about half-way up the first
      flight of stairs. Never did a man (to use a common but forcible
      expression) &ldquo;mistake his customer&rdquo; more completely. In an instant Frere
      had collared him, dragged him down a step or two, then retaining his grasp
      of the coat-collar, seized him by the waistband of his trousers, and by a
      great exertion of strength, swung him clear over the banisters, lowered
      him till his feet were about a yard from the floor, and then let him drop.
      After which performance, having glanced round to see that his victim was
      not injured by the fall, he coolly pursued his way upstairs.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rere reached the
      drawing-room in a state of mind which the occurrences related in the last
      chapter had not tended to render more amiable. The front room was
      evidently the more popular of the two, a numerous group being gathered
      round Mrs. Brahmin, who in the sweetest of mild sopranos was daintily
      cooing forth a plaintive love-ditty, which was evidently telling well with
      John Dace, D.D. Avoiding the crowd, Frere made his way into the back
      drawing-room, which, barring an ardent flirtation in a corner between two
      poor young things who could not, by the most remote possibility, marry for
      the next fifteen years, was unoccupied. Here seating himself astride
      across a chair as if it had been a horse, and leaning his arms on the
      back, he fell into a deep fit of musing. From this he was roused by the
      approach of a light footstep, and looking up, perceived Rose Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Frere,&rdquo; she exclaimed playfully, &ldquo;I do believe you were asleep;
      will you not come into the other room? Mrs. Brahmin is singing like a
      nightingale and charming everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nightingales are humbugs. I hate singing women in general, and abominate
      Mrs. Brahmin in particular, so I&rsquo;m better where I am,&rdquo; was the grumpy
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had often before received speeches from Frere quite as rude as the
      present one, but in this instance there was a peculiarity in his method of
      delivering it which at once struck her attention. Usually his bearish
      sayings were accompanied by a half-smile or merry twinkle of the eye,
      which proved that he was more than half in jest, but now there was a
      bitter earnestness in his tone which she had never before remarked, and
      Rose felt at once that something had occurred to annoy him; so she quietly
      drew a chair to the table near which he was seated, and carelessly turning
      over the pages of a book of prints which lay before her, observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not to be tempted within the siren&rsquo;s influence, and positively
      refuse to be charmed with sweets sounds, I suppose I am bound by all the
      rules of politeness to remain here and try to talk you into a more
      harmonious frame of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; returned Frere, &ldquo;unless you&rsquo;ve some better
      reason than a mere compliance with what you please to term &lsquo;the rules of
      politeness,&rsquo; for they are things I trouble my head about mighty little.
      Besides,&rdquo; he added sarcastically, &ldquo;your new friend, Mr. James Rasper, must
      have found his way upstairs by this time, I should imagine, and I should
      be sorry to deprive you of the pleasure of his intellectual conversation,
      more particularly as you seem to appreciate it so thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How viciously you said that!&rdquo; returned Rose, smiling. &ldquo;But tell me, are
      you really angry? have I done anything to annoy you? I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s most
      unwittingly on my part, if I have;&rdquo; and as she spoke she looked so good,
      and so willing to be penitent for any possible offence, that a man must
      have had the heart of an ogre to have resisted her. Such a heart, however,
      Frere appeared to possess, for he answered shortly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve no fault to find with you. I dare say it may be quite according
      to the &lsquo;rules of politeness&rsquo; to cast off old friends and take up with new
      ones at a minute&rsquo;s notice, and be completely engrossed by them, though
      they may contrive to talk about horses till they prove themselves little
      better than asses to the mind of an unprejudiced auditor. There is your
      friend conversing eagerly with Bracy, asking, no doubt, what has become of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very unjust, Mr. Frere,&rdquo; returned Rose, looking hard at her book
      and speaking eagerly and quickly. &ldquo;Mr. Rasper is no friend of mine; I
      scarcely knew his name till you mentioned it. He sat next me at dinner,
      and talked to me about horses and galloping over ploughed fields after
      foxes, till I became so stupid that I had scarcely two ideas left in my
      head, but of course I was bound to answer him civilly. So much for my new
      friend, as you call him; what you mean by my casting off old ones I don&rsquo;t
      at all know; I have done nothing of the kind that I am aware of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you have not,&rdquo; returned Frere, recalled to his better self by Rose&rsquo;s
      harangue; &ldquo;it is I who am, as you say, unjust and absurd, but the honest
      truth is that I wanted to talk to you myself. All these good people are
      bores more or less, none of&rsquo;em able to converse rationally for five
      minutes together. I meant to have handed you down to dinner, but that
      silky, scheming widow got hold of me instead and irritated me with her
      bland platitudes; and then I heard that idiot prating to you about horses&rsquo;
      legs, and you appeared so well satisfied with him, when I knew that you
      were one of the few women who could understand and appreciate better
      things, that altogether I grew savage, and could gladly have punched my
      own head or any one else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite as well Mr. Rasper was on the opposite side of the table to
      you,&rdquo; returned Rose, &ldquo;or you might have carried out your theoretical
      inclinations by practising on him, and then we should have had a scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere looked a little awkward and conscious as he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I am a bear, I am not quite such a savage animal as all that comes
      to; I do not give the fatal hug unless I am attacked first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Bracy and Mr. Rasper, whose backs were turned towards them,
      approached within earshot. The latter appeared much excited, and Rose
      heard him say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talking, I&rsquo;ve been grossly insulted, sir, and if you won&rsquo;t
      take my message to him, by&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; I&rsquo;ll take it myself, and
      give him as good as he gave me, or perhaps a little better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere heard him also, and a flash of anger passed across his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Rasper, you&rsquo;re excited,&rdquo; returned Bracy soothingly. &ldquo;I did not
      witness the affair certainly, but I cannot think that any insult was
      intended. Frere is rough in his manner, but the best-hearted fellow in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what <i>you</i> may consider an insult, Mr. Bracy; but
      taking a man by the collar and swinging him over the banisters like a cat,
      at the risk of his neck, is quite insult enough for me, one for which I&rsquo;ll
      have satisfaction, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, my dear fellow, you&rsquo;ll attract general attention if you speak so
      loud. Here, come aside with me, and we&rsquo;ll talk the matter over quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he drew Rasper&rsquo;s arm within his own, and led him through a side
      door which opened upon the staircase. Involuntarily glancing at his
      companion, Frere perceived her eyes riveted on his features with an
      expression of alarmed inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he demanded, answering her speaking look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that man so angry about?&rdquo; returned Rose breathlessly; &ldquo;what have
      you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing very wonderful,&rdquo; rejoined Frere coolly. &ldquo;The young gentleman, as
      I suppose one is bound to call him, drank rather more wine than was
      prudent, and fancying I looked a quiet, easy-tempered kind of person, by
      way of a dull jest, indulged himself with falling against and rudely
      pushing by me on the staircase; and I, not being at the moment in the
      humour for joking, did, as he very truly observes, swing him like a cat
      over the banisters, where, cat-like, he fell upon his legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Frere, how could you do such a thing? And now he is dreadfully
      angry, and talked about sending you a message, which means that he wants
      to fight a duel. Mr. Frere, you will not fight with him?&rdquo; and as Rose
      spoke her pale cheek flushed with unwonted animation, and tears, scarcely
      repressed, glistened in her earnest eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo; returned Frere, looking at her with a kind
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think, I hope, you are too good, too wise, to do such a thing. For
      Lewis&rsquo;s sake, for the sake of all your friends, you will refrain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a better reason still, my dear, warm-hearted little friend,&rdquo; returned
      Frere kindly but solemnly; &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake I will not break His
      commandment, or incur the guilt of shedding a fellow-creature&rsquo;s blood.
      But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;all this folly has frightened you;&rdquo; and as he spoke he
      took her little trembling hand in his and stroked it caressingly, and this
      time it was not withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will apologise, I suppose,&rdquo; Rose observed after a short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll hope that may not be necessary,&rdquo; returned her companion,
      &ldquo;seeing that Rasper the infuriated was more to blame in the affair than I
      was; but if the good youth is so obtuse that nothing less will quiet him,
      I suppose I must accommodate his stupidity by doing so. It is a less evil
      to pocket one&rsquo;s dignity for once in a way than to murder or be murdered in
      support of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Bracy entered the room <i>solo</i>, with such a vexed and
      anxious expression of countenance that Frere, who guessed rightly at the
      cause, could, though he liked him the better for it, scarcely forbear
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to your singing widow,&rdquo; observed Frere to Rose, &ldquo;and when I have
      administered his sop to Cerberus I will come and tell you what wry faces
      he has made in swallowing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose fixed her eyes on him with a scrutinising glance, and reading in his
      honest face that he was not deceiving her, smiled on him approvingly, and
      rising, quietly mingled with the company in the front drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Frere,&rdquo; began Bracy as Rose disappeared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sadly afraid you
      have got into a tiresome scrape. That young fool, Rasper, declares you&rsquo;ve
      pitched him over the banisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A true bill so far, and richly he deserved it,&rdquo; returned Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well believe that,&rdquo; was Bracy&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;for he was more than half
      screwed whence left the dinner-table; but the shake appears to have
      sobered him into a state of the most lively vindictiveness. However, it&rsquo;s
      no laughing matter, I can assure you: he has sent you a message by me, and
      means fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> may, but <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Frere shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Frere, I wish I could make you understand that the affair is
      serious. Rasper&rsquo;s determined to have you out. I can make no impression
      upon him, and you can&rsquo;t refuse to meet a man after pitching him over the
      banisters,&rdquo; rejoined Bracy in a tone of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I, though?&rdquo; returned Frere, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not of such a yielding
      disposition as you imagine. Where is the sweet youth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left him in the cloak-room,&rdquo; answered Bracy; and as Frere immediately
      turned to descend the stairs, continued, &ldquo; &rsquo;Pon my word, you&rsquo;d
      better not go near him: he&rsquo;s especially savage. Depend upon it, you will
      have something disagreeable occur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m going to be forced into fighting a duel, a sin of the
      first magnitude in my eyes, because I&rsquo;m afraid of meeting an angry boy?
      You don&rsquo;t know me yet,&rdquo; returned Frere sternly; and without waiting
      further parley he ran downstairs, followed by Bracy, with a face of the
      most comic perplexity. The door of the cloak-room stood half open, and at
      the further end of the apartment might be perceived the outraged Rasper,
      pacing up and down like a caged lion, &ldquo;nursing his wrath to keep it warm.&rdquo;
       Unintimidated even by this tremendous spectacle, Frere coolly entered the
      room, and immediately walked up to his late antagonist, holding out his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Mr. Rasper,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this has been a foolish business altogether,
      and the sooner we mutually forget it the better. Here&rsquo;s my hand: let&rsquo;s be
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That this was a mode of procedure on which Mr. Rasper had not calculated
      was evident, as well by his extreme embarrassment as by his appearing
      completely at a loss what course to pursue. For a moment he seemed half
      inclined to accept Frere&rsquo;s proffered hand; but his eye fell upon Bracy,
      and probably recalling the threats he had breathed forth in the hearing of
      that worthy individual, he felt that his dignity was at stake; and giving
      himself a shake to re-arouse his indignation, he replied, &ldquo;I shall do no
      such thing, sir. You have grossly insulted me, and I demand satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; returned Frere quietly, &ldquo;I did not insult you: I simply would
      not allow you to insult me; no man worthy of the name would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use jangling about it, like a couple of women, <i>I</i> consider
      that you have insulted me: what <i>you</i> may think matters nothing to
      me. I have been insulted, I require satisfaction, and I mean to have it
      too,&rdquo; reiterated Mr. Rasper, talking himself into a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen to me,&rdquo; returned Frere impressively. &ldquo;You are a younger man
      than I am, and have probably, therefore, more of life before you. You are
      of an age and temperament to enjoy life vividly. There are many that love
      you; I can answer for three, for I met your mother and two sisters at Lord
      Ambergate&rsquo;s a fortnight since, and the kind creatures entertained me for
      half-an-hour with your praises. Why, then, seek to throw away your own
      life and embitter theirs, or bring upon your head the guilt of homicide,
      entailing banishment from your home and country, and other evil
      consequences, merely because, having drunk a few extra glasses of wine,
      you sought to play off a practical joke upon me, and I, not being at the
      moment in a jesting humour, retaliated upon you, as you, or any other man
      of spirit, would have done in my situation? Come, look at it in a common
      sense point of view: is this a cause for which to lose a life or take
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After waiting a moment for a reply, during which time Rasper stood gnawing
      the finger of his white glove in irresolution, Frere resumed&mdash;&ldquo;If
      you&rsquo;re sorry for your share in the matter, I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to own
      that I am for mine; and now, once more, here&rsquo;s my hand&mdash;what do you
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, that you&rsquo;re a regular out-and-out good fellow, and that I&rsquo;m a&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
      ass, and beg your pardon heartily,&rdquo; was the energetic rejoinder; and
      bringing his hand down upon Frere&rsquo;s with a smack that re-echoed through
      the room, Rasper and his late antagonist shook hands with the strength and
      energy of a brace of giants; and then, both talking at once with the
      greatest volubility, they ascended the stairs arm in arm, Bracy following
      them, with his left eye fixed in a species of chronic wink, expressive of
      any amount of the most intense satisfaction and sagacity. As they
      re-entered the drawing-room, Rose, whose powers of hearing, always acute,
      were in the present instance rendered still more so by anxiety, caught the
      following words; &ldquo;Then you promise you will dine with me at Lovegrove&rsquo;s on
      Thursday, and I&rsquo;ll pick up half-a-dozen fellows that I know you&rsquo;ll like to
      meet, regular top-sawyers, that you&rsquo;re safe to find in the first flight,
      be it where it may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only on condition that you come to my rooms on Friday and bring your
      brother, and we&rsquo;ll show you sporting men how we bookworms live&mdash;Bracy,
      we shall see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll dine with us, too, at Blackwall, Mr. Bracy,&rdquo; rejoined the first
      speaker, who was none other than the redoubtable Rasper. And numerous
      other genial sentences of like import reached the ear and comforted the
      heart of that little philanthropist, Rose Arundel, who could no more bear
      to see her fellow-creatures disagree than could Dr. Watts, when in his
      benevolence he indicted that pretty hymn which begins&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      For &rsquo;tis their nature to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      then proceeds to state the interesting ornithological fact that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Birds in their little nests agree,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and touchingly appeals to the nobler instincts of childhood in the
      pathetic metrical remonstrance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Those little hands were never made
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To tear each other&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh! excellent and prosy Watts, doer of dull, moral platitudes into duller
      doggerel, co-tormentor with Pinnock and the Latin grammar of my early
      boyhood, would that for thy sake I had the pen of Thomas Carlyle, for then
      would I write thee down that which I suspect thou wast, my Watts, in most
      resonant un-English, nay, I would make thee the subject of a &ldquo;Latter-Day
      Pamphlet,&rdquo; and treating of thee in connection with the <i>vexata questio</i>
      of prison discipline, would by thy aid invent a new and horrible
      punishment for refractory felons, who in lieu of handcuffs and bread and
      water, hard labour, or solitary confinement, should straightway be
      condemned to a severe course of &ldquo;Watts&rsquo; Hymns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Bracy, his mind being relieved from the <i>onus</i> of this rather
      serious episode in his evening&rsquo;s amusement, now cast his eyes around to
      discover how the various schemes projected by his fertile brain might be
      progressing. The first group that met his eye afforded him unmixed
      satisfaction&mdash;Lady Lombard, seated on a low fauteuil, was listening
      with delighted attention to De Grandeville, who, hanging over her, was
      talking eagerly (about himself) with an air of the most lover-like
      devotion. The next pair that his glance fell upon scarcely pleased him so
      well, for Mrs. Brahmin had again hooked the Dace, and appeared in a fair
      way of landing him safely. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; reflected Bracy, &ldquo;one comfort is
      that he&rsquo;s such an awful fool he will bore her to death in less than a week
      after they&rsquo;re married, and she&rsquo;ll revenge herself by flirting with every
      man she meets, which is safe to worry him to distraction, and they&rsquo;ll be a
      wretched, miserable couple; so I really believe there&rsquo;ll be more comedy
      evolved by letting them alone than by interfering with them;&rdquo; and
      consoling himself with this agreeable view of the matter, he turned his
      attention to the state, mental and physical, of General Gudgeon. That
      gallant son of Mars, as though conscious of the hopes and fears that were
      abroad concerning his possible behaviour, was taking the best method of
      neutralising the dangerous effects of his devotion to Bacchus by composing
      himself to sleep in a mighty arm-chair. Next him was seated Miss MacSalvo,
      who was engaged in a truly edifying conversation with Mrs. Dackerel,
      mother to the &ldquo;postponed one,&rdquo; on the propriety of establishing a female
      Missionary Society for the prevention of Polygamy amongst the Aborigines
      of the North-Eastern Districts of South-West Australia; an evil which both
      ladies agreed to be mainly owing to the fact that the women did not know
      how to conduct themselves like the women of civilised nations; a fact to
      which Bracy assented by observing &ldquo;that was self-evident, or the men would
      find one wife quite enough;&rdquo; on which Miss MacSalvo turned up the whites,
      or more properly speaking, the yellows of her eyes, and ejaculated, &ldquo;Ah,
      yes indeed!&rdquo; with much unction, though it is to be doubted whether after
      all she perceived the full force of the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, General,&rdquo; exclaimed Bracy quickly, &ldquo;<i>you</i> have been in
      Australia; you&rsquo;re the very man we want; rouse up, my dear sir, and
      enlighten our darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; observed Miss MacSalvo, addressing General Gudgeon, &ldquo;pray,
      sir, can you give me any insight into the habits and customs of those
      interesting, but, alas! misguided individuals, the Aborigines of South
      Australia; more particularly with reference to the female portion of the
      population&mdash;any little anecdotes which may occur to you now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jo-o-ove, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; returned the General, whose English had not yet
      &lsquo;suffered a recovery&rsquo;, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve come to&mdash;you&rsquo;ve come to the right, eh&mdash;to
      the, the right, what-is-it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shop,&rdquo; suggested Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, to the right sho-op, if that&rsquo;s what you want, ma&rsquo;am. I should
      think there ain&rsquo;t a man&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t a man&mdash;eh? yes, breathing&mdash;that
      can tell you more&mdash;eh? more about larks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is scarcely with a view to the ornithology of the country that I am
      anxious to gain information,&rdquo; interrupted Miss MacSalvo; &ldquo;the facts I
      require regard the general behaviour and moral conduct of the female
      population of the north-eastern district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! oh, yes&mdash;yes, I under&mdash;I understand what you&rsquo;re up to, eh?&rdquo;
       resumed the General, with what he intended for a significant wink at
      Bracy; &ldquo;there was Tom Slasher and me&mdash;a rare wild young, eh? yes, a
      wild young dog was Tom; well, ma&rsquo;am, there was a gal over there&mdash;she
      wasn&rsquo;t one of the natives, though&mdash;they&rsquo;re taw-taw&mdash;yes, tawny
      coloured&mdash;but this gal was a nigger&mdash;reg&rsquo;lar darkie&mdash;Black-<i>hide</i>
      Susan, Tom used to call her&mdash;witty chap was Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the General being fairly started, continued to talk most volubly,
      though, from the peculiarities of his diction, he did not get to the point
      of his story so quickly as might have been expected. In the meantime Frere
      contrived to rejoin Rose, and seating himself almost in her pocket,
      observed in a low voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve managed to tame the dragon, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and persuaded him to dine <i>with</i> you instead of <i>upon</i>
      you,&rdquo; returned Rose, smiling; &ldquo;but tell me,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;how did you
      contrive to satisfy him. Were you forced to apologise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I put the thing before him in a common sense point of view,&rdquo; replied
      Frere; &ldquo;appealed to his good feeling as if I had faith in his possessing
      such a quality, which is the sure way to call it forth if it exists, and
      wound up by telling him that if he was sorry for his share in the
      business, I was ditto for mine, which mode of treatment proved eminently
      successful. He applied a forcible adjective to the word ass, and
      stigmatising himself by the epithet thus compounded, he shook me heartily
      by the hand, and straightway we became the greatest friends, ratifying the
      contract by an exchange of dinner invitations, without which ceremony no
      solemn league and covenant is considered binding in England in these days
      of enlightened civilisation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you have behaved more bravely and nobly than if you had
      fought twenty duels,&rdquo; exclaimed Rose, fairly carried away by her
      admiration. &ldquo;I esteem and respect you, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; Here
      she stopped short, and a bright blush overspread her pale features, for
      she perceived Frere&rsquo;s fine eyes fixed upon her with an expression of
      delighted surprise which she had never observed in them before, and which
      brought to her recollection the fact that, after all, he was a living man
      not many years older than herself, instead of some magnanimous,
      philosophical, and heroic character in history done into modern English
      and animated by magic for her express delectation. The light in Frere&rsquo;s
      eyes had, however, faded, and he had relapsed into his accustomed manner
      ere he replied: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I see anything to make a fuss about in it. I
      wasn&rsquo;t going to allow a half-tipsy boy to insult me with impunity, so I
      pitched him over the banisters as a trifling hint to that effect; neither
      did I feel inclined to shoot him, or let him shoot me, by way of
      compensation for his tumble, because it would have been equally wrong and
      irrational so to do, and I went and told him my ideas in plain English,
      which was the natural course to pursue, and produced the desired effect. I
      really can&rsquo;t see anything remarkable in it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy that I do,&rdquo; replied Rose archly; &ldquo;but of course we poor women
      cannot pretend to be competent judges in such a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you don&rsquo;t think anything of the kind,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      got a very good opinion of your own judgment, so don&rsquo;t tell stories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without either admitting or denying the truth of your assertion, I should
      like to know what grounds you have for making it?&rdquo; asked Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can soon tell you, if that&rsquo;s all you want to know,&rdquo; returned Frere.
      &ldquo;You could not act for yourself with the quiet decision I have before now
      seen you exercise when occasion required it unless you possessed
      self-appreciation sufficient to give you the requisite degree of
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ere Rose could reply their conversation was interrupted by a piercing
      shriek followed by an extreme bustle and confusion on the other side of
      the room. The cause was soon explained. Excited with wine, and artfully
      drawn on by Bracy, General Gudgeon had told one of his &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s
      stories&rdquo; to Miss MacSalvo, on the strength of which outrageous anecdote
      that zealous advocate for establishing a Female Missionary Society for the
      Prevention of Polygamy amongst the Aborigines of the North-Eastern
      District of South-West Australia had seen fit to go off into a perfect
      tornado of the most alarming hysterics!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL.&mdash;SHOWS, AMONGST OTHER MATTERS, HOW RICHARD FRERE PASSED A
      RESTLESS NIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he hysterical
      affection of the praiseworthy antipolygamist having taken place late in
      the evening, may be said to have broken up the party. Mrs. General
      Gudgeon, who, when the catastrophe occurred, was more or less asleep over
      the same book of prints to which she had devoted herself on her first
      arrival, originated, as she witnessed the confusion, a faint idea&mdash;(all
      this lady&rsquo;s ideas, and they were not many, were of a dim and hazy
      character, so that a good impression of her thoughts&mdash;if we may be
      allowed the term&mdash;was a rarity hardly to be met with)&mdash;that her
      better half was in some way connected with the matter; and knowing that
      dining out usually &ldquo;produced an effect upon him&rdquo; (as she delicately and
      indefinitely phrased it), she forthwith instituted an inquiry after her
      carriage, and that &ldquo;vehicle for the transmission of heavy bodies&rdquo; being
      reported in readiness, she issued marching orders, and as soon as the
      honourable and gallant officer could be got upon his legs, took him in
      tow, and in his company departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dackerels hastened to follow this example, the maternal Dackerel
      having come in for her share of the General&rsquo;s &ldquo;good things,&rdquo; and appearing
      much inclined to &ldquo;trump&rdquo; Miss MacSalvo&rsquo;s hysterics with a fainting fit; J.
      D. D., with a face even longer than usual, supported her retiring
      footsteps. He had been warming his chilly spirit in the sunshine of the
      widow&rsquo;s smiles, till, in the possibility of some day calling that delicate
      creature his own, the outline of a new and fascinating destiny had been
      traced upon the foolscap paper of his imagination; but the doom was still
      upon him, and in the calls of filial piety he recognised a fresh
      postponement even of this last forlorn hope. Frere had shaken hands with
      Rose, apologised for not being able to lunch with them the next day&mdash;a
      thing which nobody had asked him to do&mdash;and, having set the butler
      and both the tall footmen to look for his cotton umbrella, and put on
      consecutively two wrong greatcoats, was about to walk home, when Mr. James
      Rasper interfered; he would drive his friend home&mdash;anywhere&mdash;everywhere&mdash;so
      that he would but accompany him. He wanted to show him his cab; he wished
      to learn his opinion of his horse&mdash;in short, he would not be denied;
      and Frere, beginning to think his friendship a worse alternative than his
      animosity, was forced to consent, which he did thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, if you like. I shall get home sooner, that&rsquo;s one comfort; and
      I&rsquo;ve got three hours&rsquo; work to do before I can go to bed. Is this your
      trap? The brute won&rsquo;t kick, will he? Ugh! what an awkward thing to get
      into. I believe I&rsquo;ve broken my shin. Go ahead! Mind you steer clear of the
      lamp-posts. I can&rsquo;t think why people ride when they&rsquo;ve got legs to walk
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bracy waited patiently to hand Miss MacSalvo downstairs, which he did with
      much gravity and decorum, lamenting the disgraceful conduct of General
      Gudgeon, of whom he remarked, with a portentous shake of the head, that
      &ldquo;he greatly feared he was not a man of a sober or edifying frame of mind,&rdquo;
       which observation was certainly true as far as the sobriety was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Jemima of the sour countenance had, in arranging Frere&rsquo;s bed,
      imparted somewhat of the angularity of her own nature to the feathers, or
      whether the events of the evening had excited that part of his system in
      regard to the existence whereof he indulged in a very bigotry of
      scepticism, namely, his nerves, certain it is that when (having read
      Hindostanee till daylight peeped in upon his studies) he went to bed he
      did <i>not</i> follow his usual system of dropping asleep almost as soon
      as he had laid his head upon his pillow; neither could he apply his
      ordinary remedy for insomnolency, for when he tried to concentrate his
      attention on some difficult sentence in his Hindostanee, or to solve
      mentally an abstruse mathematical problem, a figure in white muslin
      obscured the Asiatic characters or entangled itself inextricably with
      rectangular triangles, so that the wished-for Q. E. D. could never be
      arrived at. Frere had never thought Rose Arundel pretty till that night&mdash;one
      reason for which might have been that he had never thought about her
      appearance at all; but now, all of a sudden, the recollection of her
      animated face as, carried away by the impulse of the moment, she had begun
      to tell him how she admired his noble conduct, occurred to him, and all
      its good points flashed upon him and haunted and oppressed him. The
      smooth, broad forehead&mdash;he had observed that before, and decided it
      to be a good forehead in a practical point of view&mdash;i.e.> a capacious
      knowledge-box; but now he felt that it was something more, and the
      mysterious attribute of beauty forced itself upon his notice and flung its
      charm around him. Then her eyes&mdash;those deep, earnest, truthful eyes&mdash;seemed
      yet to gaze at him, with a bright expression of interest sparkling through
      their softness. He could not, try as he pleased, banish the recollection
      of those eyes; as he lay and thought they came across him, and bewitched
      him like a spell. And her mouth&mdash;what a world of eloquence was there
      even in its silence; there might be traced the same firmness and
      resolution which marked the haughty curl of Lewis&rsquo;s short upper lip; but
      the pride and sternness were wanting, and in their place a chastened,
      pensive expression seemed to afford a guarantee that the strength of
      character thus indicated could alone be aroused in a good cause; but the
      true expression of that mouth was to be discovered only when a smile,
      suggestive of every softer, brighter trait of woman&rsquo;s nature, revealed the
      little pearl-like teeth. All this seemed to have come upon Frere like a
      sudden inspiration; he could not banish it from his recollection, and the
      more he reflected upon it, the less he understood it. And so he tossed and
      tumbled about, restless alike in mind and body, till at last, just as the
      clock struck six, he fell into a doze. But sleep afforded him no refuge
      from his tormentress. Rose, changed and yet the same, haunted his dreams;
      but a halo appeared to surround her&mdash;she had acquired a character of
      sanctity in his eyes. Never again could he inadvertently address her as
      &ldquo;sir,&rdquo; and he would as soon have thought of connecting the idea of a &ldquo;good
      fellow&rdquo; with one of Raphael&rsquo;s Madonnas as with Rose Arundel. At half-past
      seven Jemima&mdash;a very chronometer for punctuality&mdash;knocked at his
      door, and receiving no answer, <i>sans cérémonie</i> walked in, to see
      what might be the matter; and finding her master rather snoring than
      otherwise, invaded his slumbers by exclaiming in a shrill voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t of much use me getting out of my blessed bed with the rhumatiz
      in the small o&rsquo; my back to bring your hot-water by halfpast seven, if you
      lay there snoring like a hog, Master Richard, and won&rsquo;t answer a body when
      they call you;&rdquo; to which appeal she received the somewhat inconsequent
      reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose I wouldn&rsquo;t let him shoot me, there&rsquo;s nothing very fine in
      that, Rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to him,&rdquo; exclaimed Jemima, aghast; &ldquo;lor&rsquo; a mussy! I hope he ain&rsquo;t
      a wandering, or took to the drink. Master Richard, will ye please to wake
      and talk like a Christian, and not go frightening a body out of their
      wits,&rdquo; she continued in a tone of voice as of an agitated sea-mew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what? oh, is that you, Jemima? I was so sound asleep; go away and
      I&rsquo;ll get up directly,&rdquo; muttered Frere, becoming conscious of those usual
      colloquial antipodes, &ldquo;his room and his company.&rdquo; But Jemima had been
      flurried and rendered anxious on his account, first by his silence, next
      by his incoherent address, and now finding her alarm had been without
      foundation, her better feelings turned sour, and having her master at an
      advantage, seeing that he could not rise till she should please to convey
      herself away, she gave vent to her acidulated sentiments in the following
      harangue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all very well to say &lsquo;go away,&rsquo; as if you was speaking to a
      dog, after frightening people out of their wits by talking gibberish about
      shooting and fine roses; but I see how it is, you&rsquo;re a taking to evil
      courses, a staying out here till one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, for I heard
      ye a comin&rsquo; in, lying awake with the rhumatiz in the small o&rsquo; my back,
      drinking and smoking cigars, which spiles the teeth and hundermines the
      hintellects, and accounts for being non compo Mondays the next morning;
      but I&rsquo;ve lived with you and yours thirty year and odd, and I ain&rsquo;t a-going
      to see you rack-and-ruining of your constitution without a-speaking up to
      tell you of it, for all your looking black at the woman that nursed you
      when yer was an hinocent babby, all onconscious of sich goings on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good woman, don&rsquo;t talk such rubbish, but go away and let me get my
      things on,&rdquo; returned Frere in a species of apologetic growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish indeed!&rdquo; continued Jemima in a violent falsetto, her temper being
      thoroughly aroused by the contemptuous epithet applied to her
      unappreciated homily; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all the thanks one gets for one&rsquo;s good
      advice, is it? but I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ve lived with you, man and boy, nigh
      half my life, which, like the grass of the field, is three score years and
      ten come Michaelmas twelvemonth, and I&rsquo;m not a-going to see you take to
      evil courses without lifting up my voice as a deacon set on a hill to warn
      you against &rsquo;em, which is what your blessed mother would have done
      only too gladly if she wasn&rsquo;t an angel in the family vault, where we must
      all go when our time comes; smoking filthy cigars and stopping out till
      one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, indeed!&rdquo; and muttering these words over and
      over to herself, as a sort of <i>refrain</i>, Jemima hobbled out of the
      room with more stoutness and alacrity than could have been expected from
      her antiquated appearance. Relieved from the incubus of her presence,
      Frere rose and proceeded to dress himself; but the nightmare that had
      oppressed him, whether sleeping or waking, haunted him still.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain he tried to shave himself; the vision in white muslin came between
      his face and the looking-glass and occasioned him to cut his chin. At his
      frugal breakfast it was with him again, and strange to say, took away his
      appetite; it went out with him to his scientific institution, and weakened
      his perceptions, and absorbed his attention, and dulled his memory, till
      even the most positive resolved nebulæ swam in a mist before him, and the
      mountains of the moon, which had lately developed a new crater, might have
      been the <i>bona fide</i> productions of that planet instead of merely her
      African godchildren, for aught that he could have stated to the contrary.
      He got through his morning&rsquo;s work somehow, and then the vision prompted
      him to call at Lady Lombard&rsquo;s, and gave him no peace till he started for
      the goodly mansion of that hospitable widow, which he did in such an
      unusually agitated frame of mind, that for the first time in the memory of
      man he forgot his cotton umbrella; he hurried wildly through the streets,
      overthrowing little children and reversing apple-women, not to mention an
      insane attempt to constitute himself a member of the &ldquo;happy family,&rdquo; by
      dashing violently against the wires of their cage, which contains all
      kinds of strange animals except a Richard Frere, or a <i>Podiccps Cornutus</i>,
      till at last he reached the locality in which Lady Lombard&rsquo;s house was
      situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here a new and unaccountable crotchet took possession of his brain.
      Frere, who since he could run alone and express his sentiments
      intelligibly in his native tongue had never known what bashfulness meant,
      was seized with a sudden attack of that uncomfortable sensation, the
      extinguisher of so many would-be shining lights of humanity, who but for
      that &ldquo;flooring&rdquo; quality would have published such books and made such
      speeches that the hair of society at large, upraised with wonder and
      admiration, must have stood on end through all time, &ldquo;like quills upon the
      fretful porcupine.&rdquo; So violent was this attack of shyness that, after
      having hurried from his office as though life and death hung upon his
      speed, he could not make up his mind whether to pay the projected visit or
      not, and actually strolled up and down, passing and repassing the door
      some half-dozen times before he ventured to knock at it; nay, to such an
      extent had this mysterious &ldquo;<i>timor panico</i>&rdquo; seized upon him, that
      when the plush-clad &ldquo;man mountain&rdquo; appeared in answer to his summons he
      merely left his card, and inquiring meekly how the ladies were, posted off
      at, if anything, a more rapid pace than that at which he had walked on his
      way thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then ere he had proceeded the length of a street came the reaction, under
      the influence of which he not unjustly stigmatised himself as an egregious
      fool, and but for very shame would fain have retraced his steps. He could
      not, however, make up any credible excuse for facing the noble footman a
      second time, so as the next best thing to seeing Rose, he found his way to
      Park Crescent and called upon Lewis, to whom he related how he felt so
      restless and fidgety that he was persuaded he must be about to develop a
      feverish cold, or some analogous abomination. Having engaged Lewis to
      accompany him on the following evening to a lecture at the
      Palaeontological on &ldquo;The Relations of the Earlier Zoophytes,&rdquo; whoever they
      might be, he was about to depart, when, as he reached the hall, a
      carriage, with a splendid pair of greys, dashed up to the door, and a
      pretty little brunette with sparkling black eyes, a brilliant complexion,
      and a bonnet the colour of raspberry ice, descended, and passing Frere
      with a glance half saucy, half contemptuous, ran upstairs as if she were
      an <i>habituée</i> of the house. This was Emily, Countess Portici, Loid
      Bellefield&rsquo;s younger sister, who, having at nineteen run away with an
      Italian nobleman, for love of his black eyes and ivory complexion, had ere
      she was five-and-twenty grown heartily sick of them and of Italy, and
      discovered some good reason to quit that land of uncomfortable splendour
      to enjoy the gaieties of a London spring, leaving her picturesque husband
      to console himself as best he might during her absence. She possessed very
      high spirits without any vast amount of judgment to counterbalance them,
      and her present frame of mind was that of a school-girl rejoicing in a
      holiday, into which she was determined to cram as much pleasure, fun, and
      frolic as an unlimited capacity for enjoyment would enable her to undergo.
      On the strength of her position as a married woman, she constituted
      herself Annie&rsquo;s chaperon on all occasions when the vigilance of Minerva
      Livingstone could be eluded; and as that Gorgon of the nineteenth century
      was not so young as she had been, and found late hours tend to reduce her
      stamina and degrade the dignity of ill temper to the ignominious level of
      mere peevishness, she unwillingly allowed the Countess Portici to act as
      her substitute and escort Annie to such evening entertainments as from
      their nature threatened to invade the hours dedicated by Minerva to
      repose. There was much similarity of feature and of manner between the
      Countess and her brother Charles Leicester, only that Charley&rsquo;s languid
      drawl was in Emily replaced by a sparkling vivacity, which, together with
      a certain selfish good-nature that led her to promote the enjoyment of
      others on every occasion in which it did not come in contact with her own,
      was sufficient to render her a general favourite. Annie was no exception
      to this rule; and always delighted to escape from the petrifying influence
      of Minerva, eagerly seconded all her lively cousin&rsquo;s schemes for her
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of the Countess&rsquo;s visit on the present occasion was to secure
      Annie for the following evening, when they were to dine together, and were
      afterwards to be escorted to the Opera by Lord Bellefield, where they were
      to hear a new soprano with a voice three notes higher than that of anybody
      else, which notes might by a mild and easy figure of speech be not inaptly
      termed bank-notes, seeing that by their exercise the fair cantatrice had
      realised the satisfactory sum of thirty thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess&rsquo;s scheme happening to fit in very nicely with the views of
      the elders, as the General dined out, and Minerva was nursing a cold,
      which must have reduced the temperature of her blood to some frightful
      figure below zero, the project met with no more opposition than, from the
      constitution of Miss Livingstone&rsquo;s mind, was inevitable. And thus it came
      about that on the following day Emily called for Annie, and the two girls
      (for the matron was a very <i>girlish</i> specimen of five-and-twenty)
      drove round the park together, and then retired to Emily&rsquo;s boudoir and
      &ldquo;talked confidence&rdquo; till it was time to dress. Annie&rsquo;s revelations did not
      go much more than skin-deep, and related chiefly to anxieties concerning
      papa and difficulties with Aunt Martha, who was &ldquo;so tiresome about things,
      and never would let anybody love her,&rdquo; and then branched off to a
      retrospective sketch of the preliminary difficulties which had obstructed
      Charley Leicester&rsquo;s wedding, ending by a detailed account of the ceremony
      itself, and Annie&rsquo;s hopes and fears as to the ultimate result of the
      bridegroom&rsquo;s good resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily, on the contrary, plunged at once <i>in médias res</i>, and related
      how all last winter she had been rendered wretched by &ldquo;Alessandro&rsquo;s&rdquo;
       attentions to the Marchese Giulia di B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;ani (she
      revealed the blank in an agitated whisper), and what all her particular
      friends had said to her on the subject, and how she had jointly and
      severally replied to them that the dignity of her sex supported her;
      whence, warming with her subject, she went on to state how she in her turn
      had supported this dignity by repulsing the advances of Captain Augustus
      (familiarly and affectionately reduced, for colloquial purposes, into Gus)
      Travers, who, having been her first love, and retired <i>vice</i>
      Alessandro Conte de Portici promoted to the rank of husband, considered
      that it was again his innings, and had diligently sought to become
      platonically her third love and disputed the post of <i>cavalier servente</i>
      with all and sundry, in spite of which constancy and devotion she had
      persevered in her repulsiveness until, between her cruelty and a reckless
      indifference to malaria, poor Gus was attacked with a brain fever, and
      then of course when he grew a little better she could not continue unkind
      to him, for she might have had his life to answer for, and that was a
      serious consideration; and so by degrees he took to coming to the Palazzo
      Portici constantly and went about to places with her, and somehow she got
      accustomed to him, and Alessandro did not seem to mind, and poor Gus
      always behaved very well, and only asked to be allowed the privilege of
      her friendship, and everybody did the same sort of thing&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s their
      way over there, you know, Annie dear;&rdquo; till at last Belle-field came, and
      he had never been able to endure Gus because he was so handsome, poor
      fellow, so Bellefield made a great fuss and said all sorts of shocking
      things, and set Alessandro at her; and worse than all, quarrelled with Gus
      and wanted to horsewhip him, and it almost came to a duel, only she wrote
      Gus a little note, imploring him not to fight, but to go away and forget
      her; and he had done the first directly, and she dared say he had done the
      second, for she&rsquo;d never seen him since, which of course she was very glad
      of. And here she heaved a deep sigh and caressed a comic and unnatural
      transalpine poodle, which by reason of its flowing locks looked like an
      animated carriage mat, as though it had been a pet lamb, the sole prop of
      some heart-broken and dishevelled shepherdess, to which picture of
      pastoral pathos did Emily, Countess di Portici, then and there mentally
      assimilate herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to all this history of loves, and hates, and platonic friendships,
      whatever they might be, simple innocent Annie listened with much interest
      and more perplexity. She had a vague notion that Emily had behaved
      foolishly, if not wrongly; but she was very fond of her cousin, who, from
      the difference in their respective ages, had acquired a degree of
      ascendency over her which their natural characters scarcely warranted.
      Then Annie&rsquo;s deep ignorance of foreign manners and customs threw a mist of
      uncertainty around the whole affair, beneath the shadow of which she was
      able to put the most charitable construction on Emily&rsquo;s conduct without
      &ldquo;stultifying her moral sense&rdquo; (to speak as a logician); still she felt
      called upon to give her cousin a little good advice in regard to striving
      entirely to forget, and scrupulously to avoid for the future, the too
      fascinating Gus, for which Emily kissed her and called her a dear, silly,
      little prude; then twining their arms round each other&rsquo;s taper waists, the
      girls descended to the dining-room, united for the time being, literally
      and figuratively, by the closest bonds of amity and affection. Standing
      rather in awe of her brother, Emily conducted herself during the meal with
      so much gravity and decorum that she quite threw a shade over Annie&rsquo;s
      usual lightheartedness, and by the time they reached their opera box a
      more sombre trio (not even excepting the soprano, the tenor, and the
      baritone, of whom the first two were prepared to be poisoned, and the
      third to stab himself on their marble tomb before the evening should be
      over) could not have been found beneath the roof of Her Majesty&rsquo;s theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the acts of the opera a divertissement was introduced, in which a
      <i>danseuse</i>, who had acquired an Italian reputation, but who was as
      yet unknown in England, was to make her first appearance. Emily was
      conversing volubly about her various merits, when a fashionably-dressed
      young man with delicate features, a profusion of dark waving curls, and a
      pair of the most interesting little black moustachios imaginable, lounged
      into one of the stalls and began lazily to scrutinise the company through
      a richly-mounted opera-glass. He was undeniably handsome, but the
      expression of his face was disagreeable, and his whole demeanour blasé and
      puppyish in the extreme. As he entered, Annie perceived her cousin to give
      a violent start, and, as she met her glance, to colour slightly; then,
      evidently unwilling to attract her brother&rsquo;s notice, she made a successful
      effort to recover herself, and appeared completely absorbed in the
      terpsi-chorean prodigies of the new opera-dancer. Just at the conclusion
      of the divertissement some one knocked at the door of the box, and on Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s opening it, Annie heard a man&rsquo;s voice say, in a hurried
      manner, &ldquo;Can your Lordship allow me two minutes&rsquo; conversation? My business
      is of the utmost importance.&rdquo; Lord Bellefield replied in the affirmative
      and quitted the box, closing the door behind him. As he did so, Emily,
      laying her finger on her cousin&rsquo;s arm, said in a hurried whisper: &ldquo;Annie,
      do you see that gentleman in the fourth row of stalls, the sixth from this
      end? That&rsquo;s Gus; isn&rsquo;t he handsome, poor fellow? Ah!&rdquo; she continued, as
      the object of her scrutiny suddenly brought his opera-glass to bear upon
      their box, &ldquo;he has made me out, and he does not know that Bellefield is
      here. Oh! I hope he won&rsquo;t think of coming up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Gus, having become aware of her presence, made an almost
      imperceptible sign of recognition, and in the same quiet manner
      telegraphed an entreaty to be allowed to join her; upon which Emily
      frowned and shook her head by way of prohibition, favouring Gus afterwards
      with a pensive smile, to show that her refusal proceeded less from choice
      than from necessity. Almost as she did so Lord Bellefield returned,
      looking annoyed and anxious. &ldquo;I am obliged to leave you for half-an-hour,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;but you will be perfectly safe here, and I shall return in
      plenty of time to escort you home. You may depend upon my coming to fetch
      you.&rdquo; And almost before he finished speaking he had quitted the box and
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused and half-frightened at his sudden departure, Annie remained for a
      minute or two with her eyes fixed on the door through which he had as it
      were vanished; when she again glanced towards the stage the stall lately
      occupied by Augustus Travers was vacant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI.&mdash;ANNIE GRANT FALLS INTO DIFFICULTIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ewis, according to
      agreement, accompanied Frere to the Palaeontological, and added to the
      circle of his acquaintance those mysterious beings, the &ldquo;Relations of the
      Earlier Zoophytes.&rdquo; When the lecture was over, Frere, who had an order to
      admit two into the House of Commons, took Lewis with him to hear the
      speaking. The debate proved interesting: the Premier addressed the House
      at length; a well-known satirist rose to reply to him, remarking on
      various points in the speech with much talent and more ill-nature, and the
      minister was again on his legs to answer his opponent, when Lewis,
      glancing at his watch, discovered to his annoyance that it was
      considerably past eleven; and aware that General Grant had a particular
      objection to his servants being kept up late, communicated this fact to
      his companion, and wished him goodnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! can&rsquo;t you stay and hear &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      answer?&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and then I&rsquo;d come away, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis explained that the thing was impossible, and Frere continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what must be, must, I suppose; and as my hearing&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      reply is another inevitable necessity, I must e&rsquo;en say Good-night, so <i>Schlaffen
      sie wohl</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis grasped his proffered hand, and leaving the gallery, started on his
      homeward route. As he approached Charing Cross his attention was attracted
      by the restlessness of a magnificent horse, which, in a well-appointed
      cab, was waiting at the door of one of the houses. As he slackened his
      pace for a moment to ascertain whether the efforts made by a diminutive
      cab-groom to restrain the plunging of the fiery animal would prove
      successful, the house door was flung open, and a gentleman, apparently in
      headlong haste, sprang down the steps so recklessly that he missed his
      footing, and would have fallen had not Lewis caught him by the arm in time
      to prevent it. As the person he had thus assisted turned to thank him, the
      reflection of the gaslight fell upon his face, and Lewis recognised Lord
      Bellefield, though his features were characterised by a strange expression
      which Lewis had never observed in them before. Drawing back, he bowed
      coldly, and was about to pass on when Lord Bellefield exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay one moment, Mr. Arundel. I have been forced to leave the Opera-house
      suddenly: the Countess Portici and Miss Grant are in Lord Ashford&rsquo;s box,
      and I have promised to return to see them home, but am quite unable to do
      so. You would oblige&mdash;that is, I am sure General Grant would wish you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your lordship favour me with the loan of your pass-ticket?&rdquo;
       interrupted Lewis shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Bellefield complied with this request, Lewis remarked that his
      hand trembled to such a degree that he could scarcely grasp the ivory
      ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell the Countess that it was impossible for me to come to
      them,&rdquo; continued the young nobleman hurriedly; then passing his hand
      across his eyes, as if he were half bewildered, he sprang into the cab,
      and seizing the reins, drove off at a furious pace in the direction of
      Westminster Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis gazed after him for a moment in surprise, then turning on his heel,
      walked rapidly to the end of the Haymarket, hoping to reach the theatre
      before the opera should be concluded. In this expectation he was however
      disappointed, for when he gained the Opera Colonnade he perceived, from
      the crush of carriages and the bustle and confusion which was going on,
      that the opera was over. Hastily pushing through the crowd, he endeavoured
      to find the box Lord Bellefield had indicated, but to one as little
      acquainted as was Lewis with the intricacies of the Opera-house this was
      no such easy matter; first, he ran up considerably too high; in his
      eagerness to retrieve this error he descended as much too low; and even
      when he had attained the proper level he more than once took a wrong
      turning. At length he caught a box-keeper, who, on learning his
      difficulties, volunteered to conduct him to the box he was in search of.
      Lo, and behold, when they reached the spot the door stood open, and the
      box was tenantless!
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to explain how this awkward and embarrassing result had been
      brought about, we must beseech the reader&rsquo;s patience while we resume the
      broken thread of our narrative where we relinquished it at the end of the
      last chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Lord Bellefield quitted the box five minutes when the
      attendant opened the door and Augustus Travers made his appearance. He was
      very humble and courteous, and all he said to Emily with his tongue might
      have been printed in the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; the next morning without affording matter
      for the most arrant gossip to prate about; but the language spoken by his
      eloquent blue eyes was of a very different character. He told her vocally
      that he had been travelling in the East since they had last parted; that
      he had been unwell, had felt restless and unsettled; that he had found it
      impossible to remain contentedly in any place, had become a citizen of the
      world, a wanderer over the face of the globe; that he had only returned to
      town during the last week, and had no notion she had left Italy&mdash;dear
      Italy!&mdash;and here his eyes said, &ldquo;that country which your presence
      made a paradise to me,&rdquo; just as plainly as if his tongue had spoken the
      words (in fact they said it more plainly, for his tongue appeared to
      consider it fashionable to speak English with a slight lisp, which
      occasionally rendered his meaning indistinct); &ldquo;but when he saw her&rdquo;&mdash;continued
      his tongue&mdash;&ldquo;he could not resist coming up to her box to learn
      whether she had quite forgotten all her old friends;&rdquo; and here his eyes
      resumed that his faith in her was so strong that nothing, neither absence
      nor aught else, could in the smallest degree shake it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Emily replied that she was always delighted to see any old friend,
      but that she really was quite shocked to find him looking so ill; which
      observation she uttered with particular tenderness, because, not being
      aware that he had played French Hazard at a club in St. James&rsquo;s Street
      till five o&rsquo;clock on the previous morning, she accounted for his pale
      looks by the romantic hypothesis that he was dying for love of her. And so
      they continued to converse in an undertone, apparently much to their
      mutual satisfaction, while Annie, having bowed coldly when she was
      introduced to the fascinating Augustus, of whose presence there she
      greatly disapproved, pretended altogether to ignore him, and to turn her
      attention solely to the opera. And time ran on, till, just as the baritone
      singer was approaching, with suicidal intentions, the (imitation) marble
      tomb supposed to contain the corpses of his tenor and soprano victims, but
      which really was tenanted by a live carpenter, who, in a paper cap and
      flannel jacket, was waiting till the fall of the curtain should enable him
      to carry away the entire mausoleum, Annie, looking at her watch, perceived
      that it was past eleven, and glancing towards Emily, reminded her in dumb
      show that Lord Bellefield might be momentarily expected. This intelligence
      Emily, in a low tone, communicated to her friend, who smiled, to show his
      white teeth, and replied that &ldquo;Bellefield and he had met at Baden, and had
      become wonderful friends again;&rdquo; despite which assurance Emily still urged
      his departure, and he still lingered on, till the opera came to an end
      before Lord Bellefield made his appearance. Being Saturday night, there
      was no ballet, and the house began to empty rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can possibly have become of your brother, Emily?&rdquo; exclaimed Annie,
      who, disliking the whole situation most particularly, was fast lapsing
      into that uncomfortable state of mind familiarly termed &ldquo;a fuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will allow me, I shall be delighted to see you to your carriage,&rdquo;
       insinuated Gus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, but I am sure my brother will be here directly,&rdquo; returned
      Emily; &ldquo;he would be extremely annoyed to find that we had gone without
      waiting for him. Pray do not let us detain you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But of course Gus would not go; &ldquo;he should be wretched unless he knew they
      were in safety; he saw they were anxious, he would ascertain whether Lord
      Bellefield had returned; there might perhaps be difficulty in getting up
      their carriage,&rdquo; and so he left the box, promising to return instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>are</i> we to do, Emily, if Bellefield does not come?&rdquo; exclaimed
      Annie, pressing her hands together much as the <i>primaa donna</i> had
      done when, some quarter of an hour since, she had ejaculated at the very
      tip-top of her lofty voice, &ldquo;<i>Addesso Morir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do, you silly child?&rdquo; replied Emily, laughing, &ldquo;why, walk
      downstairs, to be sure, and allow Gus to take care of us till we can find
      the carriage. Is not he handsome, poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Annie could urge her dislike to this scheme, Travers returned,
      bringing with him a tall, good-looking boy, embarrassed by a perpetual
      consciousness of his extreme youth and his first tail-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see nothing of Lord Bellefield,&rdquo; began Gus; &ldquo;it is evident
      something must have occurred to prevent his return. Let me introduce my
      brother Alfred,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Emily; &ldquo;he was a naughty little
      boy in pinafores when you saw him last&mdash;and now what will you do?
      every one is going or gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wait a minute longer; I&rsquo;m sure he will come,&rdquo; urged Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really we cannot,&rdquo; returned Emily. &ldquo;We shall get shut up in the
      opera-house all Sunday, if we don&rsquo;t take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which would be indeed dreadfully wicked&mdash;a most terrific climax of
      depravity,&rdquo; simpered Gus. &ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you must accept my
      arm, though I am sorry the alternative should be so very disagreeable to
      you.&rdquo; These latter words he spoke in such a tone that Emily alone could
      hear them, for which he obtained a reproachful, tender, and upbraiding
      glance, with a view to which reward he had probably uttered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Annie, we positively must go,&rdquo; exclaimed her cousin impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred, why don&rsquo;t you offer Miss Grant your arm?&rdquo; chimed in Gus, drawing
      Emily&rsquo;s within his own. Thus urged, poor Annie, sorely against her will,
      accepted Alfred&rsquo;s trembling arm and quitted the box; Emily and Augustus
      Travers following. As they descended the stairs a slight confusion
      occurred: an Irish gentleman had lost his hat, and wanted to return to
      look for it, a measure against which a stout old lady, to whom he was
      acting as escort, vehemently protested, while an obsequious box-keeper was
      vainly endeavouring to understand the locality in which the embarrassed
      Hibernian imagined he had left the missing article. While Annie and her
      juvenile protector were manoeuvring to get past this group, Augustus
      Travers paused, saying in a low tone to his companion, &ldquo;Let them precede
      us; I <i>must</i> speak two words to you in private, and if I lose this
      opportunity I may never have another. Emily, if you value my peace of
      mind, I entreat you do not refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A large party, composed chiefly of young men, was descending at the
      moment, so that Emily&rsquo;s reply was inaudible, but when, having got in some
      degree clear of the confusion, Annie looked back for her chaperone,
      Travers and the Countess were nowhere to be seen. Horrified at this
      discovery, Annie stopped abruptly, exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh, we have missed Mr.
      Travers and my cousin! We had better turn back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy glanced quickly round, and as he perceived the truth of her
      assertion a meaning smile passed across his features. All traces of it
      had, however, vanished ere he replied, &ldquo;They must have turned down the
      other staircase, but it will bring them out at the same place as this
      would have done; we shall meet them at the bottom.&rdquo; Then, as his companion
      still hesitated, he continued, &ldquo;I can assure you it is so; we should only
      lose them if we were to return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half convinced by this argument, and completely frightened by the party of
      young men, who, talking and laughing, were rapidly following them, Annie
      suffered herself to be hurried on by her companion till she reached the
      foot of the staircase; here she paused and looked anxiously around for her
      cousin and Travers&mdash;they were nowhere to be seen. Annoyed,
      distressed, and frightened, she turned to her companion, exclaiming, &ldquo;They
      are not here, you see. What <i>are</i> we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, I suppose,&rdquo; returned the boy, who seemed puzzled and vexed. &ldquo;This
      is a nice trick of Master Gus&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he continued in a half soliloquy; &ldquo;he
      ought at least to have given me a hint what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Annie could inquire what he imagined his brother&rsquo;s intentions might
      be, a fresh incident diverted, and, from its disagreeable nature, soon
      wholly engrossed her attention. The crush-room, as it is called, where she
      was now standing, was occupied almost entirely by men, who, broken up into
      parties of four or five, were pacing up and down, waiting for their
      friends to join them, or standing in groups, canvassing the various merits
      and demerits of the different performers. To one or two of these coteries
      Annie soon became an object of especial notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that girl?&rdquo; whispered a pert youth with light curls and a
      turned-down collar. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a regular stunner, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ya&rsquo;as, dev&rsquo;lish pwitty, ra-ally,&rdquo; drawled a moustachiod puppy, staring
      through an eyeglass at the object of his admiration. &ldquo;Aw&mdash;I wonder
      who she possibly ca-an be. I actually don&rsquo;t know har.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;s standing there to be looked at,&rdquo; returned the first
      speaker. &ldquo;Her juvenile gallant can&rsquo;t get her along at any price, it
      seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ra&rsquo;ally, it were almost worth while to relieve him of his charge,&rdquo;
       drawled moustachios. &ldquo;He seems particularly incompetent to fill it, not&mdash;aw&mdash;equal
      to the situation&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you volunteer, Spooner, if you think so?&rdquo; urged a third
      speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na-o, I don&rsquo;t do that sort of thing&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;aw&mdash;quite a
      reformed character,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but if you wa-ant a leader for such a
      forlorn hope&mdash;aw&mdash;here comes your man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a tall, distinguished-looking individual, with much
      watch-chain and more whisker, who looked forty, but might be a year or two
      younger, lounged up to the group, and showing his teeth with a repulsive
      smile, inquired, &ldquo;What are you young reprobates grinning about, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were only saying it was a pity that young lady had not a more
      efficient protector, and advising Spooner to volunteer, Sir Gilbert,&rdquo; was
      the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the individuals?&rdquo; inquired the last comer, screwing a glass into
      the corner of his eye. A moment&rsquo;s inspection served to elucidate the
      mystery; and removing the glass with a contemptuous smile, he added, &ldquo;The
      boy is little Alfred Travers, who has just left Eton; he&rsquo;s evidently
      waiting for his brother, who, I&rsquo;ve a notion, has more strings than one to
      his bow to-night; as for the damsel, <i>noscitur a sociis</i>. We&rsquo;ll play
      the fascinating Gus a trick for once in his life. Come with me, Forester;
      I may want you to bully the boy.&rdquo; Then turning on his heel, he advanced
      towards Annie, and saluting her with a low bow, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a most unexpected pleasure! I had no idea you were here to-night;
      where have you hidden yourself this age?&rdquo; then perceiving that, confused
      by his address, and uncertain whether he might not be some acquaintance
      whose features she had failed to recognise, the young lady was completely
      at a loss how to reply, he continued, &ldquo;I see that you have been cruel
      enough to forget me; while I, on the contrary, have carried your lovely
      image in my heart, and time has failed to efface even the shadow of a
      charm. But let me be of use to you. Have you a carriage here, or will you
      allow me to place mine at your disposal? The house is becoming deserted&mdash;let
      me escort you. Stand aside, young gentleman,&rdquo; and as he spoke he advanced
      towards her, offering his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Annie, having recovered from her first surprise, felt convinced that
      the person addressing her was a total stranger, and drawing back in alarm,
      she said to her companion in a hurried whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I do not know that gentleman&mdash;there must be some mistake&mdash;pray
      let us get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus urged, the boy drew up his slight figure to its full height, and
      turning to the individual in question, said haughtily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, sir; I must trouble you to allow us to pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you who mistake jest for earnest, my good boy,&rdquo; was the
      contemptuous reply; &ldquo;the lady and I are old friends; she is merely trying
      to tease me by pretending to have forgotten me. This gentleman&rdquo; (and he
      glanced at his companion) &ldquo;will explain the matter to you.&rdquo; Then again
      offering his arm to Annie, he continued, &ldquo;Really, if you persist in your
      silly joke we shall have the carriage drive off.&rdquo; Confused by his
      pertinacity, Alfred Travers glanced at his trembling companion, and
      reading the truth in the terrified expression of her face, his boyish
      chivalry took fire, and anxious to vindicate his title to be considered a
      man, he exclaimed, angrily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back, sir, and let us pass; do you mean to insult the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person he addressed, Sir Gilbert Vivian, was a <i>roué</i> Baronet
      who, having been a man about town for the last sixteen years, and having
      long since lost all the good character he had ever possessed, and acquired
      a reputation of a diametrically opposite tendency, was scarcely a person
      to stick at trifles, laughed as he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that, Forester? This good youth accuses you of insulting the
      young lady&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t you better give him a lesson in civility?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he made a significant gesture, which the other responded to by
      exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insult the lady! what do you mean, you young cub, eh?&rdquo; and grasping him
      by the arm, he twisted him roughly round, thereby separating him from
      Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that, and find out,&rdquo; was the thoroughly school-boy answer, as,
      bounding forward, the ex-Etonian administered to his antagonist a ringing
      box on the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, save that the blow was more skilfully applied and rather harder than
      he had calculated upon, was just the result Forester had anticipated.
      Seizing the struggling boy by the collar, he declared he would give him in
      custody for an assault, and, despite his resistance, dragged him from the
      spot in a pretended search after a policeman. Availing himself of the
      confusion, the Baronet placed himself by Annie&rsquo;s side, and bending over
      her, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use waiting for the fascinating Augustus, I can assure you; he
      has other game in view to-night, and can&rsquo;t come; so for once you must
      allow me the honour of acting as his deputy&mdash;&rsquo;pon my word, you
      must,&rdquo; and as he spoke he attempted to take her arm and draw it within his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Annie! distressed, confused, and frightened, the desertion, or rather
      capture, of the boy, her only protector, had increased her alarm
      twenty-fold, and now the renewed persecution of the Baronet brought her
      fears to a climax, and attempting to withdraw her hand from his grasp, in
      a very agony of terror she exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! where <i>is</i> Emily? will nobody help me?&rdquo; and burst into a flood
      of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a tall figure suddenly interposed between them, and the
      Baronet&rsquo;s wrist was seized with such a vice-like grasp that he uttered an
      exclamation of mingled rage and pain, and dropped the little hand of which
      he had unjustly possessed himself as though it had been a red-hot cinder;
      while Annie, uttering a cry of delight, sprang forward, and clasping the
      arm of the new-comer, clung to it as some drowning wretch clings to the
      plank which shields him from the rushing waters that threaten his
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, for he it was (as every reader above the unsuspecting age of four
      and a half has of course ere this discovered for himself), understanding
      at a glance the outlines of the situation, and intuitively divining much
      of what Annie must have gone through, pitied and sympathised with her so
      deeply that the anger he would otherwise have felt against the man who had
      insulted her was completely conquered by the stronger feeling which
      absorbed him, and his only thought was how best to soothe and tranquillise
      the frightened girl who clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not alarm yourself,&rdquo; he said kindly; &ldquo;you have nothing more to fear. I
      will not leave you for a moment till you are again at home and in safety.
      Lean on my arm, you tremble so that you can scarcely walk;&rdquo; and half
      leading, half supporting her, he drew her away from the scene of her
      disasters, and passing through the crowd of loiterers whom the scuffle
      between Forester and Alfred Travers had attracted to the spot, conducted
      her towards the nearest exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      So quietly and suddenly had all this taken place, that ere Sir Gilbert
      Vivian had left off rubbing his wrist, or thoroughly realised the sudden
      frustration of his scheme, the object of his insolent attentions was
      almost out of sight. Irritated at his failure, and urged on by the
      scarcely suppressed laughter of those who had witnessed his defeat, he
      muttered an oath, and turning on his heel, followed hastily in the track
      of Annie and her deliverer. Coming up with them just as they reached the
      entrance leading into the colonnade, he tapped Lewis smartly on the
      shoulder, saying angrily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word with you, sir, if you please. I wish to ask what you mean by your
      impertinent interference. Who the d&mdash;&mdash;-l are you, I should like
      to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush of anger passed across Lewis&rsquo;s brow, and he was about to make a
      reply which would scarcely have tended to bring the matter to an amicable
      conclusion, when an almost convulsive pressure of the arm on which Annie
      hung recalled his self-control, and drawing himself up with a stern
      dignity which bespoke an apt pupil in the school of General Grant, he
      fixed his piercing eyes upon the Baronet as he answered, &ldquo;You have
      already, sir, acting probably under some <i>mistake</i>&rdquo; (and he laid a
      strong emphasis upon the last word), &ldquo;subjected this lady to an amount of
      fright and annoyance which should secure the forbearance of any one moving
      in the society of gentlemen. Should you wish to call and apologise to her
      father for your share in this unlucky adventure, I shall be happy to
      explain to you in his presence the part I have taken in the affair. There
      is my address,&rdquo; and without waiting further parley Lewis handed him his
      card, and drawing Annie gently forward, passed on. As they reached the
      entrance, a gentleman coming hastily the other way, nearly ran against
      them. Looking up, Annie perceived it to be Augustus Travers, who,
      recognising her, exclaimed, &ldquo;I have left the Countess Portici in the
      carriage, and was returning to seek for you, Miss Grant. She is much
      alarmed at having missed you.&rdquo; The only reply Annie made to this speech
      was by a slight inclination of the head, and pressing hastily forward, she
      passed on. As Lewis assisted her into the carriage, she, for the first
      time, spoke. &ldquo;You will come with us,&rdquo; she said eagerly; &ldquo;remember you have
      promised not to leave me.&rdquo; Then catching sight of Augustus Travers, who
      had followed them, a new idea struck her, and she continued, &ldquo;Tell that
      gentleman I am afraid his brother has become involved in some difficulty
      on my account; he had better go back and seek for him.&rdquo; Lewis repeated her
      message and then sprang into the carriage, which instantly drove off,
      leaving the discomfited dandy to accomplish his mission as best he might.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII.&mdash;A TÊTE-À-TÊTE, AND A TRAGEDY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> PARTY more silent
      than the trio occupying General Grant&rsquo;s carriage never drove from the door
      of Her Majesty&rsquo;s theatre. Annie, delighted to find herself once again in
      safety, leant back amidst cloaks and cushions to recover as best she might
      the effects of the terror she had undergone. Somewhat to her surprise and
      displeasure, Emily, without uttering a word by way either of explanation
      or condolence, also threw herself back among the cushions, and arranging a
      fold of her mantle so as to conceal her face, appeared unconscious of the
      presence of her companions. To this silent system they scrupulously
      adhered till they reached Conduit Street, when Emily exclaimed in a quick,
      eager tone of voice, &ldquo;Where are they going? Tell him to drive to Berkeley
      Square directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, to whom this speech was addressed, let down the window and gave the
      coachman the requisite order, and in less than five minutes the carriage
      stopped at the house occupied for the season by the Countess Portici. The
      servant let down the steps, and Lewis springing out, assisted the Countess
      to alight; as she did so she turned her head, and saying hurriedly,
      &ldquo;Annie, I shall see you tomorrow,&rdquo; entered the house, and the door closed
      after her. Lewis resumed his place, and the carriage drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she is very unkind not to have said she was sorry for having
      missed me, and I&rsquo;ll never go out with her again,&rdquo; observed Annie
      petulantly. &ldquo;And Lord Bellefield, too,&rdquo; she continued&mdash;for she had by
      this time reached that stage of recovery when, tracing back her alarm to
      its first causes, it became a relief to her to pour forth her wrongs, and
      in Lewis she felt sure of a prudent and sympathising auditor&mdash;&ldquo;it is
      all his fault for deserting us in such a shameful way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not perhaps aware that, meeting me accidentally, his lordship
      despatched me to you as his substitute,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he intend then to have come back himself, if you had been unable to
      act as his deputy?&rdquo; inquired Annie quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me it was impossible for him to do so,&rdquo; was Lewis&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if he had not happened to meet you by mere chance, he would have
      left us to find our way to the carriage as best we could. How shameful!
      just imagine what would have become of me if you had not arrived when you
      did?&mdash;that dreadful man!&mdash;I believe I should have died of
      fright.&rdquo; She paused, then added, in her usual gentle, winning voice, &ldquo;I
      must again plague you with my thanks, Mr. Arundel; you are fated always to
      render me services for which I am unable to make you any return; except by
      my sincere friendship,&rdquo; she continued timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is a reward for which a man might&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
      Lewis passionately. He was going to add, &ldquo;gladly die,&rdquo; but he checked
      himself abruptly, and if Annie could at that moment have seen his face,
      she would have been scared at the expression of despair by which it was
      characterised, an expression changing instantly to a look of the sternest
      resolution, as he continued, in a calm, grave voice, &ldquo;I mean that your
      uniform kindness and consideration have overpaid any trifling service I
      may have been fortunate enough to render you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Lord Bellefield give any reason for being unable to return to us?&rdquo;
       inquired Annie after a pause. Lewis replied in the negative, and Annie
      resumed, &ldquo;Papa will be waiting for us&mdash;he never goes to bed till I
      come home. You must tell him all you know of what has occurred, Mr.
      Arundel; and pray make him understand clearly how much my cousin is to
      blame in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if General Grant questions me I must tell him exactly what I
      have done and why I did it,&rdquo; returned Lewis gravely; &ldquo;but&mdash;may I
      indeed use the privilege of a friend, and venture for once to advise you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, pray do,&rdquo; rejoined Annie eagerly; &ldquo;I shall be so much obliged to
      you. I dare say I am going to do something very foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my acquaintance with your father&rsquo;s high and chivalrous character,&rdquo;
       continued Lewis, &ldquo;I feel sure that the facts with which I must make him
      acquainted will incense him greatly against Lord Bellefield, and as the
      General is, both from temperament and education, a man of action, his
      resentment is almost certain to lead to some practical results. Now just
      at present you are naturally and justly angry with your cousin; but young
      ladies&rsquo; anger is seldom of a very vindictive description, yours least of
      all so, and when, after frowning him into penitence, you have graciously
      forgiven him, will not a serious rupture with the General be a source of
      annoyance (to use no stronger word) both to you and to Lord Bellefield?
      All that I would recommend,&rdquo; continued Lewis, seeing that Annie bent down
      her head and made no reply, &ldquo;would be, not what the lawyers term <i>suppressio
      veri</i>&mdash;I would not for the world have you conceal anything; but
      much depends upon the spirit in which a tale is told, and I am anxious to
      save you from the subsequent regret which yielding to a momentary impulse
      of anger may cost you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me plainly what it is you think my father would do?&rdquo; inquired Annie
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;pardon me if I speak too freely&mdash;I think the General
      would resolve to break off the engagement which Mr. Leicester long since
      informed me existed between yourself and Lord Bellefield; and it was to
      save you the pain such a resolve might cost you that I ventured to offer
      you my advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; replied his companion hurriedly; &ldquo;such an arrangement
      as that to which you refer may have been, perhaps still is, contemplated;
      but the idea has always been distasteful to me, and anything which would
      preclude the possibility of further reference to it would be to me a
      subject of rejoicing rather than of regret You may think it strange in me
      to speak thus openly to you; but I am sure my confidence is not misplaced,
      and&mdash;and I am most anxious my father should understand clearly the
      insult (for I consider it no less) my cousin has to-night offered me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether the information thus communicated was a source of pain or pleasure
      to her auditor, we must leave the reader to conjecture for himself, as
      when Lewis next spoke his manner was calm and grave as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one possibility,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of which you must not entirely lose
      sight: there may have been some urgent necessity for Lord Belle-field&rsquo;s
      presence elsewhere&mdash;some sufficient reason for his apparent neglect,
      which he will only have to mention in order alike to disarm your
      indignation and that of General Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my cousin appears to have secured a most able advocate,&rdquo; returned
      Annie, with the slightest possible shade of annoyance perceivable in her
      tone. &ldquo;I was scarcely prepared to find you so zealous in his cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s face grew dark as he replied in a low, earnest voice, &ldquo;While I
      live, Lord Bellefield shall always meet with the strictest justice at my
      hands! Justice!&rdquo; he continued bitterly, &ldquo;it is a god-like principle, and
      sculptors have symbolised it well&mdash;the blinded brow, to show the
      stern singleness of heart; the scales, to weigh the merits of the case;
      and the keen sword, the agent of a sudden and full retribution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a tone of such deep and concentrated feeling, that Annie, as
      she listened to his words, trembled involuntarily. With the keenness of a
      woman&rsquo;s instinct she appreciated the intensity of the feeling and the
      power of the will that was, for the time, able to control it. For the
      time!&mdash;in that phrase lay the secret of her prescient, terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis was too much engrossed by the strength of his own emotions to
      perceive the alarm he had excited; nor was it till they reached the corner
      of Park Crescent that he again spoke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you contrive to become separated from the Countess Portici?&rdquo; he
      inquired. &ldquo;You were absolutely alone amongst those people&mdash;were you
      not?&mdash;when I came up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Annie informed him of the circumstances which led to her
      desertion when the carriage stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The General wishes to see you before you retire for the night, Miss
      Grant,&rdquo; insinuated the aristocratic butler, as, leaning on Lewis&rsquo;s arm,
      Annie entered the paternal mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my father?&rdquo; she inquired hastily&mdash;&ldquo;in the library?&rdquo;
       Receiving an affirmative answer, she continued, turning to Lewis: &ldquo;You
      must come with me; remember your promise!&mdash;I by no means consider
      myself safe till this interview is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis smiled assent; his unnatural stiffness of manner seemed to have
      disappeared like magic the moment their <i>tête-à-tête</i> was over, and
      Annie again restored to the protection of her own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General appeared in high good humour. &ldquo;You are late, you dissipated
      puss!&rdquo; he said as Annie entered. &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I did
      not know you had been of the party. What have you done with Emily and
      Bellefield, Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily is safely at home,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;she would not come further than
      Berkeley Square. As to my cousin Bellefield, he must answer for himself,
      if he is not irrecoverably lost; he chose to leave us to take care of
      ourselves. We have had an adventure, and I should have died of fright if
      Mr. Arundel had not come to my assistance like one of the good genii in
      the &lsquo;Arabian Nights&rsquo; Entertainments.&rsquo; But I must go to bed, or Aunt Martha
      will be implacable; she always examines Lisette on oath as to the precise
      moment at which she finally leaves my room. Mr. Arundel will tell you the
      whole history much better than I can&mdash;so good-night!&rdquo; and casting a
      glance, half arch, half imploring, but wholly irresistible, at Lewis, she
      glided out of the apartment, and was gone ere the General had sufficiently
      &ldquo;come at&rdquo; the meaning of her speech to attempt to detain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixing his eyes on Lewis with a look of sublime perplexity, which bordered
      closely on the ludicrous, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Pray, what is the meaning of all
      this, Mr. Arundel? Can you explain to what my daughter alluded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus called upon, Lewis was forced to narrate the adventures of the
      evening, with the details of which the reader has been already made
      acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General heard him attentively, though his brow grew dark as he
      proceeded. He listened in silence, however, till Lewis began to describe
      the scene in the crush-room at the Opera-house, when he became so much
      excited that he sprang from his seat and began pacing the apartment with
      impatient strides. At the mention of Sir Gilbert Vivian&rsquo;s impertinent
      behaviour he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A scoundrel! I remember when he was broke upon parade for insolence to
      his commanding officer. I hope you knocked him down, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt strangely tempted to do so,&rdquo; replied Lewis, &ldquo;but he had several of
      his friends with him, so that I should have been certain to get into a
      disagreeable squabble; and in that case what would have become of Miss
      Grant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, sir, very true,&rdquo; returned the General hastily; &ldquo;next to
      courage, coolness in action is the greatest attribute in a soldier&mdash;that
      is to say, in a gentleman&mdash;and I honour your forbearance for such a
      cause. Shake hands, sir!&rdquo; and suiting the action to the word, General
      Grant crossed the room, and seizing Lewis by the hand, shook it warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this unusual display of feeling Lewis&rsquo;s pale cheek flushed, and he
      continued his narration to the point when he handed Sir Gilbert Vivian his
      card. Here he paused, and continued in an embarrassed tone of voice: &ldquo;I
      dare say he will take no notice of this&mdash;but if he should&mdash;of
      course I am aware that the affair must be left entirely in your hands, and
      that it is Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s privilege to&mdash;to defend&mdash;that is,
      to chastise any insult offered to Miss Grant; but as you have so kindly
      signified your approval of my conduct in the affair hitherto&mdash;if you
      could reward me by allowing me to go out with this scoundrel&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a request so thoroughly after the General&rsquo;s own heart, that, as
      he listened to it, his little, bright eyes danced and sparkled with
      satisfaction, which he had much difficulty not to express in words; but
      his moral obligations, as a disciplinarian and the father of a family,
      came across him, and he replied: &ldquo;Duelling is a practice alike subversive
      of military discipline, and contrary to the dictates of religion; it is
      one, therefore, against which I have always&mdash;that is, for many years
      past&mdash;felt obliged to set my face. Until Lord Bellefield shall have
      afforded me some perfectly satisfactory explanation of his extraordinary
      conduct, his intercourse with this household must entirely cease; a man
      who could thus neglect his trust is the last person to whom I should dream
      of committing the honour of&mdash;ahem!&mdash;my family. As to this Sir
      Gilbert Vivian, from what I have heard of him, he is beneath the notice of
      a gentleman&mdash;quite a contemptible character; the fact of his annoying
      my daughter proves this. If it were not so, I vow to Heaven I&rsquo;d have the
      fellow out myself on Monday morning.&rdquo; And finishing with this consistent
      remark his tirade against duelling, the General resumed his peripatetic
      exercise, much to the detriment of the library carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lewis had completed his recital, his auditor again &ldquo;took the chair,&rdquo;
       and leaning his head on his hand, remained pondering the matter for some
      minutes in silence. At length he said, &ldquo;Did Lord Bellefield give you any
      possible clue to the reason why he could not return to the Opera-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said nothing, sir, to throw any light upon the matter; but when I
      accidentally met him, as I have already mentioned, he appeared much
      agitated, his features were unusually pale, and characterised by an
      expression&mdash;I should almost say of horror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any knowledge of the house he was leaving? Why do you hesitate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you frankly, General Grant,&rdquo; returned Lewis, drawing himself
      up and meeting the General&rsquo;s scrutinising glance with a clear, steadfast
      gaze. &ldquo;For some time past Lord Bellefield and I have not been on good
      terms together. Since I have lived beneath your roof he is the only person
      who has treated me ungenerously, or caused me to feel the full bitterness
      of my dependent situation. Respect for you, and a sense of my own
      position, have prevented my resenting his lordship&rsquo;s conduct as under
      other circumstances I might have done, but enough has passed between us to
      prove that we regard each other with no very friendly feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not at all aware of this&mdash;you should have told me this sooner,
      Mr. Arundel. I allow no one to be treated discourteously in my house,&rdquo;
       interrupted the General hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have mentioned the fact now, sir,&rdquo; replied Lewis calmly,
      &ldquo;had I not been anxious to explain to you why it is in the highest degree
      repugnant to me to be forced by circumstances to appear as Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s accuser, and thus lay myself open to the suspicion of being
      actuated by malicious motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one who knew you would imagine that, sir,&rdquo; returned the General; &ldquo;but
      the truth should always be spoken regardless of consequences, and you must
      yourself perceive how important it is that I should form a just estimate
      of Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s conduct in this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis paused a moment in reflection, and then replied, &ldquo;The part I have
      taken in this business was none of my own seeking, nor do I see that I am
      bound by any obligation of honour to withhold from you the only other fact
      of which I am aware in regard to the matter. I do happen to know the
      character of the house which Lord Bellefield was leaving, for as I walked
      down to the Palaeontological Society this afternoon with my friend Richard
      Frere, he pointed it out to me as a gaming-house of some notoriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of the General&rsquo;s face, when he became aware of this
      uncomfortable little fact, grew so stern, that a distressed artist,
      wishing to paint some Roman father sacrificing his son, would have given
      all the small change he might have happened to have about him at the time
      for one glimpse of that inflexible countenance. Suggestive, however, of
      evil as was this circumstance, the whole affair appeared wrapped in such a
      veil of mystery that neither General Grant nor Lewis could, as they that
      night lay awake revolving the matter in their anxious minds, arrive at any
      satisfactory hypothesis by which to account for Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s
      extraordinary behaviour. The following paragraph, which appeared in
      several of the Sunday papers, and was recopied in the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; of
      Monday, was the first thing that tended to enlighten them; it was headed
      &ldquo;appalling suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As our columns were going to press we received intelligence of one of the
      most awful catastrophes which it has ever been our melancholy duty to
      record; we refer to the untimely decease of Captain Mellerton, of the&mdash;&mdash;th
      foot, who perished by his own hand in a notorious gambling-house not far
      from Charing Cross. As far as we have been able to ascertain the facts of
      the case, the unfortunate young gentleman, who was adjutant of the&mdash;&mdash;th,
      lost a considerable sum of money (it is said £12,000) to Lord B&mdash;f&mdash;d,
      a nobleman of sporting notoriety, at the first Newmarket meeting. Being
      unable to meet so large a call upon his finances, he was induced in an
      evil hour to speculate with some of the regimental money committed to his
      charge, intending to replace it by the sale of an estate in Yorkshire; and
      having thus satisfied the demands of his noble creditor, he was on
      Saturday last unexpectedly called upon to send in his regimental accounts.
      In this extremity we have heard it rumoured that he was induced to apply
      to Lord B&mdash;f&mdash;d, as the only person on whom he had the slightest
      claim; but if we have not been misinformed, the appeal was vain, and urged
      to desperation by this failure of his last hope, the unfortunate young man
      repaired to the gaming-house in which the rash act was committed, played
      deeply, and when fortune again declared against him, drew a loaded pistol
      from his breast, and before the bystanders were aware of his design,
      terminated his existence by blowing out his brains. Captain Mellerton was
      the eldest son of the Honourable H. Mellerton, of Harrowby Park, Beds.,
      and was shortly to be married to Miss A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      daughter of Sir &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      the wedding-day being fixed immediately after the commencement of the
      recess.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII.&mdash;WHEREIN FAUST &ldquo;SETS UP&rdquo; FOR A GENTLEMAN, AND TAKES A
      COURSE OF SERIOUS READING.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen General Grant
      had perused the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; containing the paragraph with which the
      last chapter concluded, he left the remainder of his breakfast untasted,
      and hastening to the library, wrote the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord,&mdash;On learning from my daughter the uncourteous, had almost
      written ungentlemanly, manner in which you neglected her safety on
      Saturday evening, I was naturally much incensed. A paragraph referring to
      you in the &lsquo;Post&rsquo; of this morning affords a sufficient clue to the cause
      of your absence from the Opera-house, but unfortunately does so by casting
      upon you an imputation which (unless you can explain the affair to my
      entire satisfaction, which I confess appears to me improbable) must
      necessarily break off all intercourse between us. I am aware that your
      conduct may not have exceeded the limits which the world terms honourable,
      but I do not regulate my opinions by the world&rsquo;s standard, and should
      consider that I was indeed neglecting my duty as a father were I to
      entrust my daughter&rsquo;s happiness to a gamester whose success has involved
      the ruin and self-murder of a fellow-creature. These may sound harsh
      terms, but unless you can disprove that they are true ones, I for the last
      time sign myself, yours faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archibald Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having relieved his mind by penning the above epistle, he despatched a
      mounted groom to convey it to its destination, and having seen him depart,
      shut himself up, in solitary dignity, to await an answer. In less time
      than could have been imagined the groom returned bearing the following
      missive:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Bellefield presents his compliments to General Grant, and having
      perused his strangely offensive letter, begs to decline affording any
      explanation whatsoever of the conduct of which General Grant sees fit to
      disapprove. Lord Bellefield agrees in thinking that under these
      circumstances all intercourse between himself and General Grant&rsquo;s family
      had better cease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the General sat in his library pondering over this agreeable epistle
      with a rueful countenance, to which anger, vexation, and outraged dignity
      imparted a singularly undesirable expression, an eager and exciting
      conversation was being carried on in a pretty little apartment opening
      into a miniature conservatory, dedicated to the use of Annie Grant. Emily
      had arrived, all her own natural, fascinating, impulsive, silly little
      self again, and had pooh-poohed any attempt at coolness on Annie&rsquo;s part by
      throwing her arms round her neck and kissing her a very unnecessary number
      of times, under the plea of her being &ldquo;a dear, ill-used thing that <i>must</i>
      be petted.&rdquo; And having thus at one and the same time expiated her offences
      and relieved her feelings, she danced across the room, bolted the door,
      drew a heavy damask curtain over it, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re snug,&rdquo;
       danced back again, and flinging herself into an easy-chair, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Annie! I am so miserable, so utterly wretched, I must go back
      to Italy; I&rsquo;ve written to Alessandro to come and fetch me directly. I
      shall never be happy again&mdash;at least not till I&rsquo;ve quite forgotten it
      all&mdash;and that will be never.&rdquo; And here came out a little lace parody
      of a pocket-handkerchief, which, although by no means a desirable article
      wherewith to face a violent cold in the head, or at all calculated to
      withstand so much as an average sneeze, yet sufficed to dry the ghost of
      the tear which Emily&rsquo;s deep wretchedness drew from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Emily, what <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo; returned Annie, alarmed by a
      thousand vague fears, though, not having seen <i>the</i> paragraph, she
      was as yet unconscious of the darkest cloud that obscured the family
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my love, I suppose I ought not to tell you anything about it, but I
      must, for I&rsquo;ve no one else to confide in. That wretch Gus!&mdash;would you
      believe it? he actually wanted me to leave poor dear Alessandro, and to
      run away with him;&rdquo; and then with many ejaculations, and much flourishing
      of the homoeopathic sized handkerchief, she went on to relate how, when
      she became separated from Annie at the Opera-house, &ldquo;which was all that
      creature Gus&rsquo;s fault, and done on purpose,&rdquo; she was certain, the
      &ldquo;creature&rdquo; had availed himself of the opportunity he had thus secured to
      urge his undying attachment to her, which affection, despite its inherent
      principle of vitality, he declared would assuredly bring him to an early
      grave in the event of her obduracy continuing; but Emily, though
      positively a flirt, and negatively rather a goose than otherwise, was not
      unprincipled, and so when she had overcome her first impulse of surprise
      and mortification, all the virtuous wife arose within her, and she gave
      Gus to understand, by dint of sundry short, sharp, and decisive
      plain-spoken unpleasantnesses, that he had made a false move and ruined
      his game. Thence lapsing abruptly into a fit of sulky dignity, she ordered
      him, with the voice and gestures of a tragedy queen, to lead her to her
      carriage, finally despatching the foiled &ldquo;<i>Lionne</i>&rdquo; hunter to remedy
      one of his ill deeds by finding Annie, on which mission he departed in a
      state of mind the reverse of seraphic. Having concluded this historical
      episode, <i>la Contessa</i> proceeded to append thereunto certain
      annotations and reflections, in the course of which she contrived to fix
      much blame on society in general, and on Gus and Alessandro in particular,
      but none whatsoever on her own flirting manner and inordinate love of
      attention, which self-deluding analysis was by no means an original
      feature in the case, but rather an unconscious imitation of the
      proceedings of many a deeper thinker than poor little Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference between the girls was still at its height when a summons
      for Annie from her father interrupted the proceedings; whereupon Emily,
      declaring that neither her health nor spirits were then capable of
      undergoing the pain <i>forte et dure</i> of an interview with Aunt Martha,
      drove home again, to fortify her principles and console her breaking heart
      with a volume of George Sand&rsquo;s last novel. The General was in a great
      state of virtuous indignation. Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s note had been as
      gunpowder sprinkled over the smouldering embers of his wrath, and when
      Annie arrived they (or, to translate the metaphor <i>slang-icè</i>, he)
      &ldquo;flared up&rdquo; to an immense extent. He told her of all the enormities which
      the newspapers attributed to her cousin, and signified his belief that the
      case had been rather understated than otherwise; he informed her of
      Lewis&rsquo;s <i>rencontre</i> with the delinquent at the door of a
      gaming-house; he adduced the note which he had just received as a proof
      that its writer must be lost to all better feeling&mdash;utterly wanting
      in a proper respect for age and position; and, in short, he said a great
      many severe and unwise things, after the fashion of angry men in general,
      for which he was afterwards very sorry, finding such speeches easier to
      say than to unsay&mdash;which result is also by no means uncommon in
      similar cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having relieved his feelings by this explosion, he proceeded to the more
      serious business of the interview by informing her that the necessary
      consequence of these uncomfortable revelations must be the dissolution of
      all ties, present or prospective, between herself and Lord Bellefield,
      which autocratic act he performed with outward austerity and inward
      trepidation, as he fully expected Annie to receive the harsh decree with a
      violent burst of tears, and, man-like, there was nothing he dreaded so
      much&mdash;he would rather have faced a charge of cavalry any day. But to
      his surprise Annie sustained the information with a degree of stoical
      self-control that was perfectly marvellous. She neither wept, sighed, nor
      attempted the hysteric line; she only said gravely, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very sad and
      shocking; but of course, dear papa, I am ready to agree to whatever you
      think best.&rdquo; The General rubbed his hands&mdash;there was a daughter for
      you! Not a word of opposition&mdash;to hear was to obey; it actually
      restored him to good humour. He talked to her kindly and sensibly for a
      quarter of an hour, and then went out and purchased for her a valuable
      diamond bracelet, which was his idea of rewarding self-sacrifice in woman.
      And so did Annie, involuntarily and unconsciously, gain high praise and
      honour for submitting with resignation to a decree which afforded her
      unmitigated satisfaction. As she left the library she encountered poor
      Walter, who appeared in unusually high spirits. Next to Lewis, Annie held
      the foremost place in Walter&rsquo;s affections, from the unvarying patience and
      kindness with which she treated him. Moreover, having failed to inspire
      him with the degree of respect not unmingled with awe with which he was
      accustomed to regard his tutor, he looked upon her in the light of a
      companion and an equal, to whom it might be safe to confide certain
      mischievous performances in which, as his spirits acquired more
      elasticity, and his mental powers began to develop, he saw fit from time
      to time to indulge. With some such intention did he now approach her,
      whispering as he drew near, &ldquo;I want you, Annie; I want you to come with me
      and see Faust dressed like a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what, you silly boy?&rdquo; returned Annie, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me and you shall see,&rdquo; was the rhythmical and oracular
      response; and seizing her by the hand, he dragged her off in the direction
      of the sitting-room appropriated to his own use and that of his tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Arundel there?&rdquo; inquired Annie, pausing when she discovered their
      destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not att home; there&rsquo;s no other gentleman there except Mr.
      Faust,&rdquo; was the reply; and thus reassured, Annie complied with the boy&rsquo;s
      whim, and allowed him to carry her off unopposed. Now, since we have had
      any especial intercourse with that worthy dog, Faust&rsquo;s education had
      progressed rapidly as well as Walter&rsquo;s. Lewis, partly from want of
      occupation during the many weary hours his attendance on Walter
      necessitated, partly because by so doing he was enabled to excite and
      interest the feeble intellect of his poor charge, had availed himself of
      the unusual power of control he had acquired over the dog to teach him
      sundry tricks somewhat more difficult to perform than the ordinary routine
      of canine accomplishments; for instance, having perfected him in sitting
      on his hind legs in the attitude popularly supposed to represent the act
      of begging, he went on to teach him to sit thus perched up in a corner for
      a space of time gradually increasing, as by practice the animal&rsquo;s muscles
      acquired more rigidity, until at length it was no uncommon feat for him to
      remain in this attitude for an hour at literally a &ldquo;sitting.&rdquo; Moreover, if
      a light book or pamphlet were placed on his forepaws, he would support it,
      and remain gazing on the open page before him with a solemn gravity of
      countenance, indicating, apparently, the deepest interest in the work he
      seemed to be perusing. Of the results of this educational course Walter
      had on the present occasion availed himself; and accordingly, Annie, on
      her introduction to the study, found the excellent dog seated on his hind
      legs in a corner, with an extempore mantle formed of a red scarf drooping
      gracefully from his shoulders, and an old cap of Walter&rsquo;s on his head.
      Thus attired, he appeared to be conning, with an expression of puzzled
      diligence, a tract against profane swearing by Mrs. Hannah More, presented
      to Walter by Miss Livingstone on the occasion of his inadvertently making
      use in her presence of the scandalous expression, &ldquo;Bless my heart!&rdquo; Annie,
      duly impressed by this spectacle, laughed even more than Walter had hoped
      for, and told Faust that he was much the best dog in the world, in which
      assertion she was not, as we think, guilty of any great exaggeration. And
      Faust, taking the compliment to himself only when the occurrence of his
      name rendered the allusion unmistakably personal, slobbered affectionately
      with his great comic mouth, and winked with his foolish, loving eyes, and
      made abortive attempts to wag his ridiculous friendly tail, which was
      crumpled up un-wag-ably in the corner, and in the plenitude of his
      excellence sat more erect than ever, and studied his profane swearing
      still more diligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Walter&rsquo;s delight at Annie&rsquo;s amusement had in some degree
      subsided, he turned to her, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Annie, you have not found out why! told you Faust looked like a
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! because he sits there reading his book with such an air ol dignified
      composure, I suppose,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d a better reason than that,&rdquo; returned Walter, with a look of
      unusual sagacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you must tell me what it was, for I can&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; observed
      Annie good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look again, and find out,&rdquo; rejoined Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus urged, Annie examined the dog more attentively than she had done
      before, and discovered that round his neck was slung the identical gold
      watch and chain which, at her suggestion, Charles Leicester and his wife
      had given to Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve hung Mr. Arundel&rsquo;s watch round Faust&rsquo;s neck! Oh, Walter, how
      foolish of you; he might have thrown it down and broken it!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Annie, aghast at her discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; returned Walter, chuckling with delight at the success
      of his puerile attempt at a trick. &ldquo;All gentlemen wear gold watches, you
      know, and so does Mr. Faust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought not to have put it on him; I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Arundel will be very
      angry,&rdquo; resumed Annie; and kneeling down by the dog, she began untwisting
      the chain from his neck. &ldquo;Sit still, Faust; be quiet, sir,&rdquo; she continued,
      as Faust, in his affection, attempted to take an unfair advantage of the
      situation to lick her hands and face, in which act of impertinence Walter
      sedulously encouraged him; still Annie persevered, and at length succeeded
      in disengaging the chain and rescuing the watch from its dangerous
      position. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I have remedied the effects of your
      mischief, Master Walter; but I should never have been able to accomplish
      it if Faust had not been the best behaved, dearest old dog in the world;&rdquo;
       and with an impulse of girlish playfulness she threw her arms round the
      animal and pressed his rough head against her shoulder, her soft auburn
      ringlets falling like a shower of gold upon his shaggy coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Lewis, who had been to talk over his Saturday evening&rsquo;s
      adventures with Frere (or, at least, such portion of them as he chose to
      reveal, for on some subjects he was strangely reserved, even with Frere),
      returned, and finding the door ajar, entered noiselessly, and stood
      transfixed by the sight of the <i>tableau vivant</i> we have endeavoured
      to describe. He thought that he had never beheld anything so lovely in his
      life before, nor was he far wrong. The time that had elapsed since we
      first introduced Annie Grant to the reader had altered only to improve her
      beauty; her figure had gained a certain roundness of outline, and her face
      acquired a depth of expression, which had been the only finishing touches
      wanting to complete one of those rare specimens of loveliness on which we
      gaze with a speculative wonder as to why so much beauty should be, as it
      were, wasted on this world of change, and sin, and sorrow, and not
      reserved for that &ldquo;Petter Land,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Where all lovely things and fair
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Pass not away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether ideas at all analogous to these presented themselves to the mind
      of Lewis, we are unable to say; certain it is, however, that (his artist
      eye attracted by the picture before him) he stood gazing as one entranced,
      while his colour went and came, and his broad chest heaved with the
      intensity of his emotion. How long affairs might have remained in this
      position it is impossible to decide, had not Faust, becoming aware of his
      master&rsquo;s presence by some mysterious canine instinct, made an
      unceremonious attempt to free himself from Annie&rsquo;s caresses; and that
      young lady, raising her eyes, encountered those of Lewis fixed upon her
      with an expression which changed in an instant from ardent admiration to
      one of grave courtesy as he found that he was observed. Annie&rsquo;s manner, as
      she rose and came forward, afforded but little clue whether or not she had
      noticed this change, and though her colour appeared somewhat heightened,
      no want of self-possession was discernible as she said, holding up the
      watch&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what I have been rescuing from the mischievous devices of Master
      Walter! He had actually hung my cousin Charles&rsquo; present to you round
      Faust&rsquo;s neck in order to make him look like a gentleman, as he declared.
      Walter, come and answer for your misdeeds; I intend Mr. Arundel to be very
      angry with you&mdash;where are you, sir?&rdquo; and as she spoke she looked
      round for her companion, but whether really alarmed at the possibility of
      being reproved for his mischief, or whether actuated by some reasonless
      caprice of his half-developed intellect, Walter was nowhere to be found;
      so Lewis, having thanked Annie for her care of his watch, politely held
      open the door for her to depart. But when kidnapped by Walter, Annie had
      been carrying am armful of books, and Lewis, becoming aware of this fact,
      could do no less than offer to take them up to the drawing-room for her.
      Having accomplished this feat, he was about to retire, when it occurred to
      him that he was bound in common civility to inquire whether she had
      sustained any ill effects from her alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Annie; &ldquo;thanks to your kindness and consideration, I am
      literally <i>quitte pour la peur?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she added hesitatingly, &ldquo;you have ere this learned the sad
      cause of Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s absence on Saturday night?&rdquo; and on Lewis
      replying in the affirmative, she continued, &ldquo;And do you believe all that
      the newspapers insinuate? Can my cousin have really behaved so very
      wickedly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called on my friend Richard Frere this morning,&rdquo; returned Lewis, &ldquo;and I
      hear from him that the main facts of the case are matters of notoriety;
      for instance, racing men are well aware that Lord Bellefield won a large
      sum of money from this unfortunate young man; nor would your cousin
      attempt to deny that it is so. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the
      fashionable London world to hazard an opinion on the subject; but Frere,
      who knows everybody, says the story has gained universal credence; and
      though by no means disposed to judge human nature severely, believes in it
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very, very shocking,&rdquo; murmured Annie; &ldquo;and I had hoped it could not
      be true, but papa is much incensed, and believes it fully; and I fancy you
      do also, although, having such just cause to dislike my cousin, you are
      too generous to blame him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you are mistaken,&rdquo; returned Lewis kindly; for her manner
      confirmed him in an impression which had arisen in his mind that the
      distaste she had expressed to the engagement with Lord Bellefield would
      vanish as her anger at his neglect cooled. &ldquo;Indeed, I do not think so; on
      the contrary, I have a strong conviction that the affair has been
      misrepresented and exaggerated, and that your cousin will be able to clear
      himself, not only to your satisfaction, but to that of General Grant
      also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie impetuously; and then, ere the words were
      well spoken, she continued, &ldquo;No, I do not mean that. How wicked of me to
      say so! but, oh! it is such joy to feel that I am free&mdash;free as air!&rdquo;
       Then observing that Lewis&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon her with an inquiring
      glance, though his lips framed no sound, she added with a bright blush,
      &ldquo;Yes, you were a true prophet, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; and turning abruptly, she
      quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lewis! Did he rejoice that the man he hated was thus crossed in his
      dearest wishes&mdash;thus held up to public obloquy? Strange as many will
      deem it, he did not. On the contrary&mdash;except on Annie&rsquo;s account&mdash;he
      was annoyed at the turn events had taken. In the first place, although the
      facts were so strong that he could not reasonably discredit the reports
      that were in circulation, he felt a sort of instinctive belief that Lord
      Bellefield was not guilty of all the evil laid to his charge. He recalled
      the expression of his face as he had seen it on the night of the suicide;
      it had not been that of a man hardened in crime, who had left the victim
      of his betting schemes unaided in his extremity to seek refuge from
      dishonour in the madness of self-destruction, but rather that of a being
      of mixed good and evil startled by some frightful reality of life into a
      condition of temporary remorse. If Lewis could have realised his exact
      wishes at this moment, he would have desired to clear Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s
      character by his own unassisted efforts, and as a reward, to have called
      him out the next morning and fought with small swords (pistols would have
      decided the matter too quickly to satisfy him) till one or both should
      have furnished subjects for the undertaker. Then his thoughts reverted to
      Annie&mdash;she was free, and rejoiced in her freedom, therefore she was
      to be won. Watch his features as the idea strikes him: first a flush of
      joy, crimsoning brow and cheek, fading to the pale hue of despair; then
      the clenched hand and compressed lips, that tell of the strong will
      battling with, ay, and conquering&mdash;for the will is as yet the
      stronger&mdash;the germs of a consuming passion. Brave young heart,
      tasting for the first time the full bitterness of life, angels might have
      wept to view thy gallant striving!
    </p>
    <p>
      The aphorism embodying the statement that a storm is usually followed by a
      calm, although by no means original, is not on that account the less true;
      nor in tracing the course of events in the household of General Grant
      shall we discover an exception to this rule in the &ldquo;Law of Storms.&rdquo;
       Immediately after the incident we have related. Lord Bellefield (probably
      wishing to escape the disagreeable notoriety likely to be obtained by his
      share in the catastrophe) escorted his sister to Italy, without making any
      attempt to deprecate the anger of General Grant; and although the Marquis
      of Ashford, who greatly desired that the proposed matrimonial alliance
      should take place (hoping that marriage might wean his son from various
      expensive pursuits, of the nature whereof the reader may have gleaned some
      faint idea from the previous course of this narrative), made sundry
      attempts to effect a reconciliation, the General remained implacable. From
      his new position, as occasional secretary to her father, Lewis was thrown
      into constant intercourse with Annie, while, from the deservedly high
      opinion General Grant had formed of him, he was treated more as a friend
      than a dependant. Before Mrs. Arundel and Rose left London, Annie obtained
      her father&rsquo;s permission to invite the latter to spend a few days with
      them. Rose placed the invitation in Lewis&rsquo;s hand before showing it even to
      Mrs. Arundel. She divined that her brother would feel strongly on the
      subject, and determined to be guided by his wishes. He read Annie&rsquo;s note
      in silence: it was like herself&mdash;simple, frank, and warm-hearted; it
      was accompanied by a few lines from the General&mdash;kind (for him) and
      courteous in the extreme. &ldquo;Miss Arundel would confer an obligation on his
      daughter by allowing her the opportunity of becoming acquainted with,&rdquo;
       etc., etc. The General had heard of Rose&rsquo;s literary reputation, and looked
      upon her as a second Madame de Staël. A woman who had written a book
      appeared to his simplicity a thing as wonderful as, in these latter days,
      when, to speak poetically, the sun of literature is obscured by the leafy
      greenness of the softer sex, we are accustomed to regard a woman who has
      never done so. Lewis read the two notes; there was not a shadow of
      patronage from beginning to end at which the most rampant pride could take
      offence&mdash;the invitation was unexceptionable; and then a crowd of
      conflicting ideas rushed upon him, and he paced the apartment for once in
      a state of the most complete indecision. This was not a mood of mind which
      could ever continue long with Lewis, and pausing abruptly, he said, &ldquo;I
      really do not see how you can well refuse, after such a very kind note
      from&mdash;from the General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to accept it, dear Lewis, since you wish it as well
      as myself; I long to know more of that sweet Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be disappointed if you expect to find Miss Grant unusually
      clever,&rdquo; returned Lewis moodily. &ldquo;She has good natural abilities, but
      nothing more, neither has she been accustomed to live amongst intellectual
      people; she is by no means your equal in point of talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose looked surprised at this depreciatory speech; she considered Annie so
      fascinating that she did not imagine it in man&rsquo;s nature to criticise her
      unfavourably, and that Lewis, of all people, should do so was very
      incomprehensible. She only replied, however, &ldquo;Miss Grant is much more
      accomplished than I am, at all events; she sketches like an artist, plays
      with great taste and execution, and sings most sweetly. I do not think it
      by any means an advantage to a woman to be unusually clever: it tends to
      force her out of her proper sphere, and to urge her to a degree of
      publicity repugnant to all the better instincts of her nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis cordially. &ldquo;A woman should have a
      quick, vigorous intellect, to enable her to perceive and appreciate the
      good, the true, and the beautiful, but nothing beyond. With a single
      exception, dear Rose, I consider literary women complete anomalies, things
      to wonder at and to pity; depend upon it, few women who devote their lives
      to literature are really happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis ceased speaking Rose sat for some moments pondering the truth of
      the opinions which he, in common with many of the best and wisest of his
      sex, held on this subject. At length she said, &ldquo;I agree, and yet I differ
      with you. Surely a fine mind is one of the noblest gifts God can bestow
      upon His creature, because,&rdquo; she added reverently, &ldquo;the higher the
      intellect the nearer it must approach to His own perfect wisdom; therefore
      talent ought to be a boon to woman as well as to man; but is it not in the
      application of that talent that the mischief lies? If the consciousness of
      mental superiority unfits a woman for the performance of her natural
      duties, instead of enabling her to fulfil them more thoroughly, the fault
      rests not in the gift, which is in itself a privilege, but in the
      misapplication of it by the person on whom it is bestowed. Retirement is a
      woman&rsquo;s natural position, and anything which leads her to forsake it tends
      to unsex and deteriorate her. I do not say that it must necessarily do so;
      if, for instance, some pious motive, such as a desire to assist her
      family, actuates her, she often appears to be protected from the dangers
      which surround the path which she has chosen, but that these dangers are
      great and many it is vain to deny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion is,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis, &ldquo;that amongst either men or women those
      only should write books who, from some cause or other, are so thoroughly
      imbued with their subject that utterance becomes as it were a necessity;
      then, and then only, do they produce anything great and good. The
      strongest argument I know against women writing is that they never appear
      to exceed pleasing mediocrity. You have no female Shakespeare or Milton&mdash;even
      Byron and Scott are unapproached by the bravest of your literary Amazons.
      Certainly women should not write and having uttered this opinion much as
      if he would have liked to alter the &lsquo;should&rsquo; into &lsquo;shall,&rsquo; and to be made
      autocrat of England till he had purged the land from blue-stockings.&rdquo;
       Lewis took his hat and departed, leaving that &ldquo;talented authoress,&rdquo; his
      sister, to chew the cud of his encouraging observations as best she might.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical result of this conversation was that Rose spent a week in
      Park Crescent, and thus the occurrences thereof fell out. Miss Livingstone
      first catechised, then patronised the young tutor&rsquo;s sister. The General
      also tried a pompously condescending system, but Rose&rsquo;s sweetness subdued
      the old soldier; and ere the week had passed he became devoted to her, and
      in his stately fashion loved her only a little less than his own daughter.
      And Annie&mdash;she first began by being afraid of her new acquaintance
      because she was an authoress; then she discovered that she was not so
      alarming-, after all; next it occurred to her that she was very sensible;
      afterwards that she was very affectionate, which went a great way with
      Annie; and finally, that she was quite perfect, and exactly <i>the</i>
      friend she had been all her life pining for. From the moment she
      discovered this, which was once upon a time when Rose, carried away by the
      heat of congenial conversation, began to talk about her brother, she
      delighted to lay bare her pure, girlish heart to her new-found friend. And
      what does the reader suppose it contained? Any very mysterious secret, any
      dire and soul-harrowing episode, as became the heart of a heroine? Alas,
      for poor, degenerate Annie! there were no such interesting contents in her
      warm little bosom, only much simplicity, sundry good resolutions
      containing the germs of future self-discipline, great natural amiability,
      a ready appreciation of all that was excellent in art or nature, and an
      open and unbounded admiration of, and respect for, the character of Lewis;
      so open indeed that Rose thankfully acknowledged to her secret soul that
      one alarming possibility which had lately occurred to and haunted her&mdash;viz.,
      that Annie and Lewis were falling in love with each other&mdash;could have
      no foundation in fact. The only drawback to Rose&rsquo;s pleasure in her visit
      was, strange to say, the behaviour of her brother. His manner when alone
      with her&mdash;and the delicate tact of Annie Grant afforded them many
      opportunities for a <i>tête-à-tête</i>&mdash;was wayward and fitful in the
      extreme. Sometimes, but very seldom, he appeared low and out of spirits;
      at others he was cold and sarcastic, or even perverse and unjust; and
      though these fits were invariably followed by expressions of the most
      affectionate regard towards Rose herself, yet the idea with which they
      impressed her was that his mind was ill at ease, and that for some reason
      which he studiously concealed, he was unhappy. The week passed away like a
      dream, and Annie, as she parted from her new friend, felt as if some being
      of a superior order, endowed with power to make and to keep her good, were
      leaving her again to fight single-handed with the trials and temptations
      of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frere had been despatched by his scientific superiors to inspect certain
      organic remains which had come to light during the formation of a railroad
      cutting in the north of Ireland; which remains, assuming to be the
      vertebræ and shin bone of an utter impossibility (the
      comparative-anatomical sketch, which Frere designed on the <i>ex pede
      Herculem</i> principle, represented the lamented deceased as a species of
      winged hippopotamus, with a bird&rsquo;s head, a crocodile&rsquo;s tail, and something
      resembling an inverted umbrella round its camelopard-like neck, forming a
      whole more picturesque than probable), excited the deepest interest in the
      world of science, which lasted till, unluckily, one of the workmen,
      striking his pick-axe against a partially imbedded bone, found that the
      Rumpaddyostodon (for so had Frere&rsquo;s <i>chef</i> already named it) was
      composed of Irish oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere Frere returned from this expedition Mrs. Arundel and Rose had quitted
      London, a fact which annoyed that gentleman more than he could reasonably
      account for. Having, however, recovered from his strange fit of shyness,
      he wrote Rose a long account of his adventures, winding up by originating
      a pressing invitation to himself to spend a fortnight with them during the
      vacation, which invitation he not only accepted most graciously, but with
      the utmost benevolence volunteered to prolong to three weeks, if he could
      possibly manage it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, shortly after the departure of his mother and sister, received what
      Annie termed &ldquo;marching orders&rdquo;&mdash;viz., an intimation that on a certain
      day and hour he and his pupil were to hold themselves in readiness to
      start for Broadhurst, it being one of the General&rsquo;s pet idiosyncrasies to
      manage his family movements <i>saltatim</i>, by jerks, as it were, which
      disagreeable habit he had acquired during his campaigning days, when the
      exigencies of military service necessitated such abrupt proceedings. The
      consequence of this particular exercise of discipline was that Lewis
      received the following note on the evening before their departure:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;Learning this morning, accidentally, that you are about
      to leave town to-morrow, and wishing much to see you on a matter of some
      importance before you do so, shall I be putting you to any great
      inconvenience if I ask you to do me the favour of breakfasting with me
      to-morrow? Name your own hour, from six o&rsquo;clock downwards. My boy is
      waiting, or more properly (you know his mendacious propensities) <i>lying</i>
      in wait for your answer. N.B.&mdash;I am aware of the utter vileness of
      that pun, but my ink is so confoundedly thick that really I could not make
      a better one.

      &ldquo;Please, sir, they ain&rsquo;t none of &rsquo;em come,&rdquo; responded the
      individual thus addressed, who was no less a personage than the tiger &ldquo;for
      falsehood famed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew he&rsquo;d say that,&rdquo; observed Bracy aside, with a look of exultation,
      &ldquo;I knew he&rsquo;d say so, because I saw the man bring them five minutes ago;
      sharp boy! he never loses an opportunity of lying. Perhaps they may have
      arrived while you&rsquo;ve been up here,&rdquo; he continued blandly; &ldquo;go and see,
      Orphy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call your tiger?&rdquo; inquired Lewis as the imp disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, his real name is Dick Timmins,&rdquo; returned Bracy; &ldquo;I have taken the
      trouble to ascertain that fact beyond a doubt&mdash;of course I should not
      have believed it merely upon his authority&mdash;but I call him Orphy,
      which is a convenient abbreviation of Orpheus, because, like that
      meritorious mythical musician, he is at all times and seasons perfectly
      inseparable from a <i>lyre!</i> &lsquo;a poor pun,&rsquo; sir, &lsquo;but mine own.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must surely be inconvenient and troublesome to be obliged perpetually
      to guard against some deception or other, to be in continual doubt as to
      what has or what has not taken place in your household,&rdquo; remarked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, my dear Arundel, there&rsquo;s the beauty of it,&rdquo; returned Bracy.
      &ldquo;Others doubt and are perplexed, but I am never at a loss for a moment; I
      know all his most intricate involutions of lying, and can track him
      through a course of falsehood as a greyhound follows a hare: that boy
      could not deceive me unless he were suddenly to take to telling the truth;
      but there&rsquo;s not the least fear of that, his principles are too well
      established. Ah! <i>inter alia</i>, here he comes&mdash;do you see the
      pun? pre-suppose an Irish brogue, and accent the penultimate instead of
      the first syllable in the second word, and it&rsquo;s not such a bad one after
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, to use the popular lyric style, the &ldquo;false one had departed,&rdquo; and
      the gentlemen were again left <i>tête-à-tête</i>, Lewis, reminding his
      companion that his time was short, hinted that it would not be amiss if he
      were at once to acquaint him with the business to which he had referred in
      his note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, to be sure,&rdquo; replied Bracy; &ldquo;it was a letter I had from Frere
      yesterday which put the thing into my head. Let us see, what does he say?&rdquo;
       And pulling a letter from his pocket, he ran his eye down it, reading and
      soliloquising somewhat after the following fashion: &ldquo;Hum! ha! &lsquo;never take
      shares in an Irish railway&rsquo;&mdash;thank ye, I never mean to&mdash;&lsquo;the
      natives in these parts are not Cannibals, at which no one at all
      particular in his eating would wonder, after seeing the state of filth&rsquo;&mdash;well,
      I won&rsquo;t read that, it will spoil our breakfast&mdash;&lsquo;the organic remains
      are coming out splendidly; I feel little doubt they must have belonged to
      some antediluvian monster yet unknown to science.&rsquo; Ah! the fossil remains
      of a pre-Adamite Irish bull, probably; and that&rsquo;s another, by Jove, for
      there would have been nobody to make it at that time of day: there&rsquo;s a
      P.S. about it, though&mdash;Ah! here it is&mdash;&lsquo;only fancy, my organic
      remains prove to be vegetable, not animal; nothing more or less than a new
      species of Irish Oaks.&rsquo; A new species of Irish <i>Hoax</i> rather; I
      wonder how he came to miss the pun&mdash;some men do throw away their
      opportunities sadly; but I&rsquo;m wasting your time&mdash;now then&mdash;&lsquo;in
      regard to what you tell me about the Bellefield affair, I can do nothing,
      not being on the spot; your best plan will be to communicate with Lewis
      Arundel&mdash;he is thoroughly <i>au fait</i> as to the whole matter; tell
      him everything, and act according to his advice. You may safely do so. I
      always thought his lordship a great scoundrel&rsquo; (rather strong language!),
      &lsquo;but in this case he appears more to be pitied than blamed; I like
      fair-play all the world over, and would give even the devil his due.&rsquo;
      There,&rdquo; continued Bracy, folding up the letter, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what Richard Frere
      says, and I, knowing his advice to be good, am prepared to act upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be good,&rdquo; returned Lewis in a tone of annoyance, &ldquo;but as far as I
      am concerned *it is particularly enigmatical. There are many reasons why
      it is undesirable, I may say impossible, for me to interfere with Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, if you are the man I take you to be,&rdquo; replied Bracy seriously,
      &ldquo;you would not wish any one to labour under an unjust imputation, from
      which a word of truth can set him free. But it&rsquo;s no use beating about the
      bush; hear what I have to say, and then you can act or remain neuter, as
      you please. Of course you read the newspaper account of that sad business
      about poor Mellerton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis replied in the affirmative, and Bracy continued, &ldquo;Except in one or
      two points, the statement was substantially correct, but these happen to
      be rather important ones. In the first place, I should tell you that
      Mellerton was an intimate friend of my own. We were great cronies at Eton,
      and never lost sight of each other afterwards. I first heard of this
      betting affair from an officer of high rank, who holds an appointment by
      which he is necessarily a good deal behind the scenes at the War Office.
      Somehow it reached his ears that Mellerton had been betting heavily and
      met with severe losses, and knowing that I had some influence with him, he
      wished me to give him a friendly hint, which I accordingly did. Mellerton
      took it very well, poor fellow! and thanked me for my advice, which was
      his invariable custom, though I can&rsquo;t say he usually acted upon it. He
      confessed that he had lost more money than was convenient, and told me he
      had been forced to borrow, but the amount of his losses he studiously
      concealed. On the morning of the day of his death the same person sent for
      me again, and told me he was afraid Mellerton had been behaving very
      madly, and in the strictest confidence informed me that it was determined
      upon to examine into his accounts, and that if, as he feared, they would
      not bear the light, his character would be blasted for life, adding that I
      was at liberty to warn him of this, and give him an opportunity, if
      possible, of replacing the money. Owing to a chapter of accidents, as ill
      luck would have it, I was unable to meet with Mellerton till late in the
      evening, when I found him in a state of distraction, having just received
      officially the information I had sought to forestall. Seeing how much I
      knew already, he told me everything. I will not recapitulate the miserable
      details, but the newspapers did not overstate the truth. Well, as a
      forlorn hope, I suggested the appeal to Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s generosity, and
      after much persuasion he agreed to let me make the trial. I sprang into a
      hansom cab, and drove like the wind to Ashford House. Bellefield was
      dining with his sister; I followed him to Berkeley Square, and then to the
      Opera-house, where I lost not a minute in explaining my business. Well,
      sir, instead of rejecting the appeal, as has been reported, Lord
      Belle-field appeared greatly distressed at the intelligence&mdash;jumped
      into his cab, taking me with him, and as we drove down to poor Mellerton&rsquo;s
      lodgings, expressed his readiness to do whatever I thought best&mdash;adding
      that he had £10,000 at his banker&rsquo;s, which was quite at Mellerton&rsquo;s
      service till he could sell his Yorkshire estate. The rest of the tale you
      know. The poor fellow, thinking, from my prolonged absence, that my
      attempt had failed, and unable to bear the disgrace of exposure, placed a
      loaded pistol in his pocket, repaired to a gaming-table, betted to the
      full amount of his defalcation, lost, and blew his brains out. We got
      there just as the surgeon they had sent for declared life was extinct; and
      you never saw a man so cut up as Bellefield was about it. He accused
      himself of being a murderer, and in fact seemed to feel the thing nearly
      as much as I did myself. As soon as he had a little recovered he
      volunteered to drive to Knightsbridge, to break the thing to poor Fred
      Mellerton&rsquo;s brother, while I did the same by his mother and sisters; and a
      nice scene I had of it&mdash;I thought the old lady would have died on the
      spot. But now, to come to the point, I hear that old Grant, believing all
      the newspaper lies, has quarrelled with his intended son-in-law and broken
      off the engagement; and that Lord Bellefield, too proud to make any
      explanations, has allowed him to continue in his mistake. Is this so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no reason to believe your information incorrect,&rdquo; was the cautious
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, don&rsquo;t you think it is due to Lord Bellefield to acquaint
      General Grant with the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis paused for a minute or two in thought ere he replied, &ldquo;Certainly; it
      would be most unjust to withhold it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very glad you agree with me,&rdquo; returned Bracy, rubbing his hands
      with the air of a man who has escaped some disagreeable duty. &ldquo;Then I may
      depend upon you to set the matter right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon me!&rdquo; rejoined Lewis in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what Frere expects. You see,
      it&rsquo;s rather a delicate affair for a man to interfere in, particularly one
      who is a complete stranger. I don&rsquo;t believe I ever set eyes on Governor
      Grant in my life. Now you, living in the house, can find a hundred
      opportunities. There is a good deal in selecting the <i>mollia tempora
      fandi</i> with men as well as with women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am to understand that you have related these facts to me for the
      express purpose of my communicating them to General Grant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure. Do you think I should have put you to the inconvenience
      of coming here this morning merely for the sake of having a gossip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I were to refuse to make this communication?&rdquo; continued
      Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a supposition never occurred to me,&rdquo; replied Bracy in amazement;
      &ldquo;but if you were to do such an unexpected thing, matters must take their
      own course. In telling you, I&rsquo;ve done all that I consider I am in any way
      called upon to do; if you, for any reason, deem it unadvisable to
      enlighten General Grant, there the thing must rest. Frere tells me to be
      guided by your advice, and so I shall; as I have just said, I leave it
      entirely to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you perfectly,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis, and as he spoke a
      contemptuous smile curled his lip; &ldquo;still, justice requires that the
      General should not be kept in ignorance, and although there are many
      reasons why it is painful and objectionable to me to enlighten him, yet
      there are others which prevent my refusing; and now, Mr. Bracy, as my time
      is short, you will excuse my being obliged to leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; returned Bracy, as his visitor rose to depart;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Liberty Hall this, sir! <i>chacun à son gout</i>, &lsquo;everybody has the
      gout,&rsquo; as the little girl at the boarding-school construed it. Then you&rsquo;ll
      make Governor Grant comprehend that in this particular instance Bellefield
      behaved like a brick? Disagreeable business to be obliged to interfere in,
      but, as Frere says, you&rsquo;re just the man to do it; good morning;&rdquo; and
      uttering these words with the greatest <i>empressement</i>, he shook
      Lewis&rsquo;s hand warmly and suffered him to depart. As the door closed on his
      retreating figure Bracy threw himself back in an easy-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in the wind that I&rsquo;m not awake to,&rdquo; he muttered in
      soliloquy; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t comprehend that good youth at all. There must be
      private feeling mixed up in it; something in the love and murder line, I
      suspect. How savage he looked when he undertook the job&mdash;rather he
      than I, though: Bellefield&rsquo;s as likely to call a man out, as to say Thank
      ye, for interfering; but, as Frere says, Arundel&rsquo;s just the man to carry
      the thing through. He&rsquo;s a plucky young fellow and deucedly good-looking,
      but he certainly does not appreciate wit&mdash;ahem&mdash;that is, puns&mdash;properly;&rdquo;
       and with this reflection Bracy took pen and paper and sate him down to
      indite an essay on moral courage and the responsibility of man, wherewith
      to fill up a vacant corner of Blunt&rsquo;s Magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lewis&mdash;what a task had he undertaken! He who would have made any
      sacrifice to gratify Annie&rsquo;s lightest wish must now bring the first cloud
      over the sunshine of her young life; he must be the means of reconciling
      her father and Lord Bellefield; he must, by his own act, give the woman he
      loved to the man he hated. The woman he loved!&mdash;had then the fear
      that had lain cold and heavy at his heart, that had come between him and&mdash;resignation,
      assumed a definite shape? did he at length own that he, the poor tutor,
      the paid dependent, loved the rich man&rsquo;s daughter? Oh! Lewis, where was
      thy pride&mdash;where that Hell-angel beautiful in evil, which hath
      haunted thee even from thy childhood upwards like a second self? Had
      Rose&rsquo;s tears prevailed and thy pride deserted thee? Would that it had been
      so; but no, he had not yet learned that hardest lesson for the young and
      manly-hearted, self-distrust; his bosom-sin clave to him, and striving
      single-handed, how should he subdue it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis was not one of those who deceive themselves long on any point; and
      his emotions after the scene at the Opera-house, the amount of
      self-control he was obliged to exert to restrain any outbreak of feeling
      in the <i>tête-à-tête</i> drive with Annie, had revealed the truth to him,
      and ere he slept that night he knew that now indeed was the sum of his
      wretchedness complete; for he loved, for the first time, one fitted to
      call forth all the depth and earnestness of his passionate nature, and he
      loved without hope. Pressing his hands to his burning brow, he sat down
      calmly to think. Calmly; yes, the treacherous repose of the smouldering
      volcano were an apt illustration of such a forced calmness. Renunciation
      and self-conquest! this then was his portion for the time to come.
      Self-conquest! Pride caught at the word; an enemy strong as the strength
      of will which should subdue it. Reason cried, &ldquo;Flee from temptation;&rdquo; but
      pride whispered, &ldquo;The task is worthy of you; accomplish it.&rdquo; And
      resolution aided pride, and the iron will came into play, and the contest
      was begun. And now the reader can understand why Lewis&rsquo;s interview with
      Bracy would scarcely tend to raise his spirits, or render his general
      frame of mind more satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctual to the moment the carriage made its appearance, drawn by four
      posters; and the General and the two ladies ensconced themselves in the
      interior, while, the day being lovely, Lewis and his pupil took possession
      of the rumble. About two miles from Broadhurst was a steep hill; on
      reaching this point Annie and her father, Lewis and Walter alighted, with
      the intention of walking up; but before half the distance was accomplished
      the General pleaded guilty to a very decided twinge of gout, and unwilling
      to provoke a second, reentered the carriage, the others continuing their
      pedestrian exertions without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie, delighted to regain the freedom of the country, was in high
      spirits. &ldquo;Why do people stay in London at this time of year?&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;This lovely sky, and the trees, and the birds, and the
      sunshine, are worth all the operas and pictures and balls and every sight
      or amusement London can afford; those things excite one for an hour or
      two, but this makes me perfectly happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis glanced at her for a moment, sighed involuntarily, and then rousing
      himself, uttered some commonplace civility, which so clearly proved that
      he was forcing himself to make conversation from the subject of which his
      thoughts were far away, that Annie, struck by his manner, paused and fixed
      her large eyes earnestly upon him. At length she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you are ill or unhappy, Mr. Arundel. I am now too well aware
      how utterly unable I am to compensate for the loss of such a friend and
      counsellor as dear Rose (oh! how I envy you that sister!), but if you
      would sometimes tell me when you are annoyed or out of spirits, instead of
      wrapping yourself in that cold, proud mantle of reserve, I think even such
      poor sympathy as mine might make you happier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis glanced round. Walter, actuated by some caprice of his wayward
      intellect, had run on before&mdash;they were virtually alone. Now it had
      occurred to Lewis that, as Annie had allowed him to perceive her dislike
      to the idea of a union with Lord Bellefield, he should entirely lose her
      good opinion were she to learn that it was through his representations
      that a reconciliation with her father had been brought about; and although
      this would have been a very desirable result for many reasons, and have
      materially assisted him in his design of conquering his unhappy
      attachment, yet he by no means appeared to approve of the notion, but on
      the contrary had, with his usual fearlessness, determined to seize the
      first opportunity of explaining to her why reason and justice obliged him
      to act in opposition to her wishes. And now that the opportunity had
      arrived, the considerate kindness of her address disarmed him, and in the
      unwillingness to inflict pain on her he half abandoned his purpose; but
      here his strength of will&mdash;that fearful agent for good or for evil&mdash;came
      into action and settled the matter. It was right; it must be done.
      Accordingly he thanked her for her kindness, made her a pretty speech as
      to valuing her sympathy, which expressed somewhere about one-fifteenth of
      what he really felt on the subject&mdash;said, which was quite true, that
      nothing had for a long time afforded him greater pleasure than the
      friendship which had sprung up between her and Rose&mdash;then, speaking
      in a low, calm voice, he continued, &ldquo;I have been both grieved and annoyed
      this morning; you guessed rightly when you thought so. Will you forgive
      me, and still regard me as your friend, when I tell you that circumstances
      force me to act in direct opposition to your wishes, and to do that of
      which I fear you will highly disapprove?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie looked at him with an expression of surprise and alarm, which gave
      way to a bright, trustful smile as she replied, &ldquo;Nothing can lead me to
      doubt your friendship, Mr. Arundel; I have had proofs of its sincerity too
      convincing for me ever to do so. If you are obliged to say or do anything
      which may pain me, I am sure you feel it to be duty which compels you. And
      now tell me what you refer to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lewis! the smile and the speech went straight to his heart, like the
      stroke of a poniard: pride, resolution, and all the other false gods he
      relied on disappeared before it; and for the moment love was lord of all.
      But self-control had become so habitual to him, that the most acute
      observer could not have detected the slightest indication of the inward
      struggle; and ere he spoke his will had resumed its mastery, and his
      purpose held good. He gave her, in as few words as possible, an account of
      his interview with Bracy; and told her that it was his intention
      immediately to acquaint General Grant with the facts that had thus come to
      his knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him in silence; and when he had finished she said in a low
      voice, which thrilled with suppressed emotion, &ldquo;My father will forgive
      him, and all will be as if this thing had never happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on side by side, but neither spoke. At length Lewis said
      abruptly, &ldquo;I have told you this man and I were not on friendly terms; I
      now tell you that he has heaped insult after insult upon me till I <i>hate</i>
      him. Yes, you may start, and your gentle woman&rsquo;s nature may condemn me,
      but it is so: I hate him.&rdquo; He spoke calmly, but it only rendered his words
      more terrible, for it told not merely of the angry impulse of the moment,
      but of the deep conviction of a lifetime; and Annie shuddered as she
      listened. Regardless of her emotion, Lewis continued, &ldquo;Circumstances have
      in this instance forced me to appear as Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s successful
      accuser. To some minds this petty triumph might have afforded
      satisfaction; to me it has been a source of unmixed regret; the
      retribution I seek is not of such a nature. Fate has now placed in my
      hands the means of vindicating his character; and every principle of
      honour, nay of common justice, binds me to do so. We may not do evil that
      good may come. I should forfeit my self-respect for ever were I to conceal
      this knowledge from your father. You would not have me do so, I am
      certain?&rdquo; Lewis paused for a reply; there was silence for a moment, and
      then in a low, broken voice Annie said, &ldquo;No! you <i>must</i> tell him. But
      I am very, very unhappy!&rdquo; And uttering the last words with a convulsive
      sob, she covered her face with her hands, and turned away to conceal the
      tears she could no longer repress.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hether the sight
      of Annie&rsquo;s tears would have produced any change in Lewis&rsquo;s determination,
      had their <i>tête-à-tête</i> continued uninterrupted, is a question in
      regard to which psychologists may arrive at any conclusion which pleases
      them; for Walter having literally, or figuratively, caught his butterfly,
      rejoined his companions almost immediately, and under cover of his puerile
      volubility Annie contrived to dry her eyes and outwardly regain her
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the following morning Lewis found an opportunity of
      making the important communication. General Grant heard him with grave
      attention, and when he had concluded, observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This alters the whole aspect of the affair. Any man may commit a fault,
      but if he sees his error, and is willing by every means at his command to
      atone for it, it behoves all generous-minded persons to forgive him. I
      perceive that I have, in this instance, acted hastily, and owe Lord
      Bellefield reparation. I shall write to him immediately, and have to thank
      you, Mr. Arundel, for affording me this information, which may give me an
      opportunity of effecting a reconciliation with one on whom I had long
      since decided to bestow my daughter&rsquo;s hand. Your disinterested, I may say
      magnanimous conduct in this matter, entitles you to my fullest confidence.
      I shall make it an express stipulation that for the future Lord Bellefield
      shall evince all due consideration towards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this speech, and the haunting memory of Annie&rsquo;s tears, were Lewis&rsquo;s
      reward for doing his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this communication was that the General wrote a long letter
      to Lord Bellefield, using many words to express his meaning, which might
      have been advantageously compressed into half the number; however, it
      satisfied its composer, who considered it a miracle of diplomacy and a
      model of style. Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s answer was cold and haughty; his pride
      had been wounded, and his was not a mind frankly to forgive an injury of
      that nature; still he did not reject the General&rsquo;s overtures. He was going
      to travel in Greece (he wrote), but on his return to England he would see
      General Grant and refute the calumnies which had been spread to his
      disadvantage: he was aware that he had enemies who might be glad to avail
      themselves of any opportunity to vilify his character, but he trusted to
      the General&rsquo;s sense of justice to discourage such attempts. And the
      contents of this letter were communicated to Annie by her father, together
      with a rebuke for having so easily believed reports to her cousin&rsquo;s
      disadvantage, which lecture somewhat failed in its effect from the unlucky
      fact that, in this particular instance, the lecturer&rsquo;s practice happened
      to have been diametrically opposed to his preaching; but the rebuke led to
      one evil result&mdash;viz., it crushed in the bud a half-formed project
      which Annie had conceived of acquainting her father with her growing
      disinclination to a union with her cousin, and of imploring him to take no
      step towards a renewal of the engagement. Moral courage (save when her
      feelings were very strongly excited) was not one of Annie&rsquo;s attributes,
      and as the evil she feared was not a proximate one, she trusted to chance
      to postpone it still further, if not to avert it altogether. Thus, being
      naturally of a light-hearted, joyous temperament, she ere long recovered
      her usual gaiety, and an occasional sigh, or a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s
      unwonted abstraction, alone attested her recollection of this dark speck
      on the horizon of her future life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The return to Broadhurst appeared to produce a soothing effect upon Lewis
      also&mdash;it gave him an opportunity calmly to review his position; and a
      new idea struck him, generalising from which he sketched out a system
      different from that which he had hitherto pursued in regard to Annie
      Grant. True, he could never hope to call her his&mdash;love was forbidden
      him&mdash;but friendship, warm, ardent friendship&mdash;love elevated,
      spiritualised, purified from the slightest admixture of passion,&mdash;this
      he might enjoy safely; it only required a strong effort of will, a
      determined, uniform exercise of self-control. To be enslaved by hopeless
      love was mere weakness; to crush the sentiment entirely was Quixotic and
      uncalled for; but to control and regulate it, to fix limits which it
      should not exceed, and thus to convert a curse into a blessing, this was
      an effort worthy of a reasonable being, and this he would accomplish. In
      order to carry out this design he determined no longer to avoid Annie as
      he had done; it was cowardly to fly thus from temptation; besides, it was
      evidently useless to do so; imagination supplied the deficiency, and the
      evil was but increased. No, he would face the danger and subdue it. Thus,
      too, he might be of use to her, for with all his admiration of her
      character he read it aright, and saw that there were weak points which
      required the aid of principle to strengthen them; that her pursuits were
      frivolous, her mind uncultivated, and her existence practically aimless,
      because her views of life were confused and indistinct, and her standard
      of excellence a visionary one. All this he saw, and seeing, felt that he
      could remedy. And while he pondered on these things Annie recalled an old
      wish to study German, and asked her father&rsquo;s permission to be allowed to
      do so, if Mr. Arundel could find time to give her lessons; whereupon the
      General, having a great respect for any language of which he was
      personally ignorant, preferred her request to Lewis, and that young
      gentleman was graciously pleased to accede thereunto. Miss Livingstone of
      course played duenna, and but for one circumstance would have performed
      her character with a degree of cold-blooded virulence worthy of the most
      fractious tigress that ever mangled &ldquo;lovers tender and true.&rdquo; This
      fortunate circumstance was that the lessons, being usually taken by way of
      dessert after an early dinner, invariably sent Minerva to sleep. In vain
      did she bring out her &ldquo;poor basket,&rdquo; in which receptacle lay hid certain
      harsh underclothing for infant paupers; in vain did she attempt sewing the
      seams of Procustes-like pinafores, which, solving the problem of the
      minimum of brown holland capable of containing a living child, were
      destined to compress the sturdy bodies of village urchins; the &ldquo;<i>colo
      calathisve Minervo</i>&rdquo; were unable to resist the attacks of the god
      Somnus, and ere Annie had stretched her pretty little mouth by the
      utterance of a dozen double-bodied substantives, the lynx-eyes were closed
      in sleep, and for all practical purposes Miss Livingstone forfeited every
      right to the first half of her patronymic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, if you are of the gender which uncourteous grammarians are pleased
      to designate the worthier, tell me,&mdash;in strict confidence, of course,&mdash;did
      you ever read German with a pair of bright eyes turning from the crabbed
      Teutonic characters to look appealingly into your own optics, while two
      coral lips, formed for pleasanter purposes than growling German gutturals,
      complain of some enigmatical sentence which has <i>not</i> got a right
      meaning to it, the said eyes and lips being the outward symbols of a warm
      heart and quick intelligence, ready to discern and feel the grandeur of
      Schiller, the Shakespeare of the Fatherland, or thrill to the trumpet
      blasts of young Korner&rsquo;s warrior spirit, or trace the more subtle
      thinkings of Goethe, that anatomist of the soul of man? Tell me, did you
      ever read with so desirable a fellow-student? If you have done so, and can
      honestly say you did not think such schooling delightful, the sooner you
      close this book the better, for depend upon it there is little sympathy
      between us. Lewis at all events had no cause to be dissatisfied with his
      pupil, who was equally docile and intelligent, and in a marvellously short
      space of time was able to read and translate with tolerable fluency; while
      the few German sentences in which her instructor from time to time saw fit
      to address her appeared less like heathen Greek to her at each repetition.
      As soon as she had sufficiently mastered the difficulties of those
      aggravating parts of speech, the compound separable verbs, and acquired
      moderate control over other equally necessary and vicious parts of the
      grammar, they commenced translating that most poetical of allegories, La
      Motte Fouqué&rsquo;s &ldquo;Undine&rdquo;; and Annie, as they read, took it all at first <i>au
      pied de la lettre</i>, and imagined, with a degree of shuddering horror,
      which, as it was <i>only</i> a tale, was rather pleasant than otherwise,
      all the supernatural uncomfortables Huldbrand underwent in the Enchanted
      Forest, and admired all the generous impulses of the heroine&rsquo;s singular
      uncle-and-water, Kuhleborn, who, however, she considered would have been
      better adapted for family purposes, if he had been rather more of a man
      and less of a cataract. Then Undine herself, the capricious, fascinating,
      tricksy sprite&mdash;the thoughtful, loving, feeling woman&mdash;how Annie
      sympathised with and adored her! For Huldbrand she felt a species of
      contemptuous pity, but Bertalda, oh! she was sure no woman was ever so
      heartless, so utterly and wickedly selfish. And then when Lewis unfolded
      to her his view of the Allegory (every one is sure to form a particular
      theory of his own as to the meaning of &ldquo;Undine,&rdquo; and to think he only has
      discovered the author&rsquo;s intention), and Annie learned that the tale
      shadowed forth the mighty truths which throng the passage to eternity, and
      symbolising the struggle between good and evil, showed how Principalities
      and Powers wage throughout all time an undying warfare&mdash;the breast of
      man their battlefield&mdash;her pulses quickened and her cheek flushed;
      for she felt for the first time the solemn realities of existence, and saw
      dimly how a single life might be a link between the Ages, and a portion,
      however insignificant, of the mighty whole. What wonder then if part of
      the reverence, the awe, chastened by a deep, solemn joy, with which she
      recognised the workings of Infinite power, and Infinite love, cast their
      spell around him who had first awakened these perceptions within her?&mdash;what
      wonder if unconsciously comparing him with those around her, she grew to
      believe him a being of another and a higher nature, and so to hang on his
      slightest word or look, to dread his frown, and deem his smile sufficient
      compensation for hours of unwonted study?
    </p>
    <p>
      The German lessons seemed to agree particularly well with Lewis also; for
      his eye grew brighter and his step more free, the extreme paleness of his
      complexion changed to a manly brown, a slight tinge of colour imparted a
      look of health to his cheek, and&mdash;unromantic as it may appear&mdash;his
      appetite increased alarmingly. Would the reader learn the secret of this
      improvement? It is soon told. Living in the present, blinding himself to
      the truth, he was happy! His system, he told himself, had succeeded&mdash;his
      theory had been tested, and proved a true one&mdash;resolution had
      conquered, and the insanity of love had cooled down to the reasonableness
      of a delightful friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis was excessively pleased with himself at this result. At length,
      then, he had attained that complete and perfect degree of self-control he
      had so long endeavoured to acquire; his feelings were reduced to a due
      submission to his will; and henceforward his happiness was in his own
      hands. And thus basking in this gleam of sunshine, he shut his eyes to all
      beyond, and dreamed that he possessed an elixir to dissipate every cloud,
      and that henceforward storms would disappear from the horizon of his
      destiny and become mere myths, existing only in memory. And these were
      some of the earliest results of the German lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time a small but unpleasant adventure occurred to poor Annie
      which occasioned her a severe fright, and rendered her nervous and
      uncomfortable for many days afterwards. She had been on an expedition to
      the cottage of a poor neighbour who was suffering from illness; and as the
      sick woman lived beyond a walk, Annie had gone on horseback, attended by
      an old coachman who had lived in the family many years. Having
      accomplished her mission, she had ridden about a quarter of a mile on her
      return when she discovered that she had left her handkerchief behind, and
      directing the servant to ride back and fetch it, she proceeded at a foot&rsquo;s
      pace in a homeward direction. The road she was following wound round the
      base of a hill thickly covered with trees and underwood, the spreading
      branches of the oaks meeting across the lane and making a species of
      twilight even at midday.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Annie Grant was passing under one of the thickest of these trees, a
      tall, gaunt figure sprang from behind its knotted trunk and seized the
      bridle of her pony. Gazing in alarm at her assailant, Annie perceived him
      to be a man of unusual stature; his features were pale and emaciated, and
      an unshorn, grizzly beard added to the ferocity of their expression; his
      clothes, which were torn and soiled, hung loosely about him, while the
      long bony fingers which clutched her bridle-rein, the sunken cheeks, and
      hollow, glaring eye-balls, gave evidence that his herculean proportions
      had been reduced almost to a skeleton leanness by disease or want. Annie
      had, however, little time to make observations, for, accosting her with an
      oath, the ruffian demanded her purse. Drawing it forth, she held it to him
      with a trembling hand. He seized it eagerly and examined its contents, his
      eyes glittering as he observed the sparkle of gold. Hastily concealing it
      about his person, he next demanded her watch, which Annie, after a
      hopeless glance in the direction from which she expected the appearance of
      the servant, also relinquished. Having secured his plunder the fellow
      paused, apparently reflecting whether by detaining her longer he could
      gain any further advantage; as he did so the sound of a horse rapidly
      advancing struck his ear, and immediately afterwards a turn in the road
      enabled him to perceive the figure of a servant on horseback, the sunshine
      glancing from his bright livery buttons. The moment this object met his
      view he started, and shading his eyes with his hand, gazed fixedly at the
      approaching horseman. Having thus satisfied himself as to the man&rsquo;s
      identity, he exclaimed with an oath, &ldquo;It is the old bloodhound&rsquo;s livery,
      and the girl must be his daughter. Oh, what a chance I have thrown away!
      Yes,&rdquo; he continued, turning fiercely upon poor Annie and threatening her
      with his clenched fist, &ldquo;if I had guessed you were the daughter of that
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; old Grant, you should not have got off so
      easy, I promise you.&rdquo; He paused as a new idea struck him, and his face
      assumed an expression of diabolical revenge; placing his hand in his
      breast he drew forth a pistol, cocked it, and muttering, &ldquo;There is time
      yet,&rdquo; levelled it at his trembling victim. With a faint scream Annie
      dropped the reins, and clasping her hands in an agony of fear, murmured a
      petition for mercy. The ruffian stood for a moment irresolute; but,
      desperate as he was, some touch of humanity yet lingered in his breast, a
      softening recollection came across him, and muttering, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, she
      looks like poor Jane,&rdquo; he uncocked and replaced the pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the servant, having heard Annie&rsquo;s scream, came up at a
      gallop, and the robber, uttering a fearful imprecation, sprang back into
      the wood and disappeared among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some minutes before Annie, who was on the verge of fainting, was
      able to give a coherent account of the adventure which had befallen her.
      As soon, however, as she had in some degree recovered from the effects of
      her terror, she desired the servant to ride close beside her, and urging
      her pony into a rapid canter, made the best of her way home. Here she
      found matters in a state of unusual bustle and confusion. The General had
      received information that Hardy the poacher had broken out of H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      gaol, effected his escape unperceived, and was supposed to be concealed
      somewhere in the neighbourhood of Broadhurst. Accordingly he was
      marshalling all the available males of his establishment, preparatory to
      setting out on an expedition to search for, and if possible to apprehend
      the escaped felon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was his horror and indignation when he learned the danger to which
      his daughter had been exposed, and ascertained from the description she
      gave of her assailant that the man who had robbed her, and even threatened
      her life, was none other than the ruffian Hardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations which he had already made he now considered insufficient
      for ensuring the success of the expedition; he accordingly despatched a
      mounted groom to procure the assistance of a couple of policemen, and
      sending for Lewis, begged him to lead a party to search the country in one
      direction, while he proceeded with a second division of the household
      forces in another. As the young tutor heard of the alarm to which Annie
      had been subjected, his cheeks flushed and his compressed lips quivered.
      He said little, however, but returning to his room, placed a brace of
      small pistols in the breast of his coat, attached spurs to the heels of
      his boots, then mounting a horse which was in readiness for him, rode off.
      The tenants were roused, the gamekeepers summoned, the policemen arrived.
      General Grant remained absent till nearly ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and his
      daughter became alarmed to the last degree for his safety. At length he
      returned; their search had been unsuccessful, but Mr. Arundel and some of
      the men would remain on the watch all night, and he would resume the
      pursuit next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days and nights Lewis never entered a house, and was scarcely
      out of the saddle; the fourth day the police received a report from the
      authorities at Liverpool, stating that an individual in some degree
      corresponding to the description of Hardy had taken his passage in a
      vessel bound for the United States, and that the wind being favourable,
      the ship had sailed before they had been able to search her; and with this
      unsatisfactory report the family at Broadhurst were forced to content
      themselves.

      CHAPTER XLVI.&mdash;IS CALCULATED TO &ldquo;MURDER SLEEP&rdquo; FOR ALL NERVOUS YOUNG
      LADIES WHO READ IT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he incident
      related in the last chapter produced a strange and alarming effect upon
      Miss Livingstone; in fact it may be said to have laid the foundation of a
      species of monomania which haunted her to the day of her death. From this
      time forth she laboured under the delusion that a man trained from his
      youth up to rob and murder his sleeping fellow-creatures was secreted at
      one and the same moment under every bed and behind all the window curtains
      in the house. A singular and alarming property belonging to this ambushed
      ruffian was the extraordinary shadow cast by his legs and feet. Miss
      Livingstone was perpetually scared by discovering it in the most unlikely
      places and positions; indeed the statistics of these shadowy phenomena
      tended to show that it was this villain&rsquo;s ordinary custom to stand upon
      his rascally head. Then the noises he made were most strange and
      unearthly, and a habit he possessed of moaning whenever the wind was high
      really exceeded anything with which human nature could be expected to put
      up. The trouble he occasioned everybody was inconceivable; for at least a
      month after Annie&rsquo;s adventure the butler almost lived in Minerva&rsquo;s
      bedroom, so constantly was he summoned to unearth this lurking traitor;
      and yet, although Miss Livingstone was quite certain the monster was
      there, for she had seen the shadow of his boots, with the soles upwards,
      upon the tester of the bed, by some dreadful fatality he always contrived
      to evade the strictest search. Once Miss Livingstone thought she <i>had</i>
      got him, for, having summoned assistance on the strength of hearing him
      snore, she actually enjoyed the satisfaction of being sworn at by him,
      when she looked under the bed and poked for him with a large umbrella; but
      this time he turned out to be the cat. The servants became so harassed by
      these repeated alarums that at length the butler gave <i>bona fide</i>
      warning, while the footmen, when there was nobody to hear them, vehemently
      protested they were not hired as thief-catchers, and that Miss Livingstone
      had better set up a private policeman of her own, if she chose to be so
      subject to house-breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis was not at all pleased with this adventure: in the first place, it
      interrupted the German lessons, for poor Annie had been so seriously
      frightened&mdash;not without cause&mdash;that it made her really ill, and
      for some days she remained on a sofa in her own room. In the second place,
      Lewis had been so deeply affected when he first heard of the danger to
      which she had been exposed, that for a moment a doubt crossed his mind
      whether such a degree of emotion was exactly consistent with that mild
      imposition yclept platonic friendship. In the third place, he had used his
      best endeavours to catch Hardy once again, and had been thoroughly and
      completely baffled. Time, however, that wonder-working individual, passed
      on, and by his assistance Annie&rsquo;s nerves recovered their tone, and the
      German lessons were recommenced; Miss Livingstone saw fewer visions of
      reversed legs, and confined her researches after the concealed one to a
      good peep under the bed night and morning. The General made a great fuss
      about the whole affair, and severely reprimanded several individuals for
      permitting Hardy to escape who never had it in their power to prevent his
      doing so. Having relieved his mind by this judicious exercise of
      authority, he applied himself to other pursuits, and speedily forgot the
      whole transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two months after the occurrence of the robbery Lord Belle-field
      wrote to announce his return, and General Grant went to London alone in
      order to meet him. Before his departure, Annie, whose dislike to the
      interrupted engagement appeared to increase rather than to diminish,
      determined to make a great effort, and to acquaint her father with her
      disinclination to the proposed alliance, and to entreat him to take no
      steps which might lead to a renewal of the matrimonial project. The
      General heard her attentively, and then observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perfectly understand and appreciate your feelings, my dear Annie; they
      are such as, under the peculiar circumstances, become <i>my</i> daughter.
      Remember, my dear, that the matter is in wiser and more experienced hands
      than yours; and rest assured that nothing shall be done of which even your
      punctilious delicacy and true sense of honour can disapprove.&rdquo; Then,
      seeing Annie was about to speak, he continued, &ldquo;Any further discussion is
      not only unnecessary, but as the matter now stands, would appear to imply
      a doubt of my capability of acting for you; which I should consider, to
      say the least, disrespectful. You will oblige me by withdrawing, my dear
      Annie.&rdquo; Thus saying, he rose, and opening the door with all the frigid
      courtesy of the Grandisonian school, ushered her out. And so poor Annie&rsquo;s
      attempt proved a signal failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning the General left Broadhurst, having given Annie a
      very unnecessary caution against riding out with merely a servant, and
      made it his especial request that Lewis and Walter should accompany her by
      way of escort; a proceeding of which neither tutor nor pupil appeared to
      disapprove.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant was absent for more than a fortnight; and as the weather was
      unusually fine during the whole of the time, Annie and her attendants rode
      out every day. Oh, those rides! what delightful expeditions were they! By
      a tacit consent between Lewis and Annie, all allusion to the future was
      avoided, in word or thought; they lived in the present&mdash;those loving
      hearts; they were together, and that sufficed them; and the trees appeared
      greener, and the flowers more brilliant, and the sunshine brighter, than
      they had ever seemed before; all was happy as a fairy dream, and
      dream-like did it pass away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter from the General announcing his intended return was in Annie&rsquo;s
      hand, as, bending over a ponderous volume of crabbed characters, she
      awaited her German lesson. The windows of the breakfast-room in which she
      was seated opened on to an ample lawn, interspersed with groups of shrubs
      and gay flower-beds. In crossing this lawn Walter had contrived to
      intercept Lewis and inveigle him into a game at ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flushed by the exercise, his eyes sparkling with excitement, and his dark
      curls hanging in wild disorder about his brow, the young tutor approached
      the window at which Annie was seated. Concealed by the heavy folds of the
      window curtain, the girl watched him unperceived: involuntarily she
      contrasted his frank and easy bearing, his free and elastic step, and the
      smile, half proud, half playful, which parted his curved lips and sparkled
      in his flashing eyes, with the cold reserve which usually characterised
      his demeanour, and for the first time she became aware what a bright and
      noble nature had been obscured and warped by the false position into which
      circumstances had combined to force him. Who could blame her, who rather
      would not love her the better, and thank God that He has implanted such
      beautiful instincts in every true woman&rsquo;s heart, if she felt that she
      should wish no fairer destiny than to devote her life to bring back the
      sunshine of his, and by her affection restore to him the youth of soul
      which misfortune had wrested from him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Little guessing the thoughts that were passing through her mind, Lewis
      advanced towards the window, exclaiming, &ldquo;Miss Grant, I have a petition to
      urge&mdash;the day is so lovely it is quite wicked to remain indoors: can
      I persuade you to use your influence with Miss Livingstone to allow us to
      transfer the site of our German lesson to the bench under the lime-tree? I
      will promise to arrange a most seductive seat for her in the very shadiest
      corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt has departed on a charitable mission,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;she
      received a message to say that an unfortunate child whom she has been
      doctoring out of that dreadful medicine chest of hers is much worse, and
      she has rushed off armed with pills and powders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give it the <i>coup de grace</i> I suppose,&rdquo; interrupted Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie shook her head reprovingly, and continued, &ldquo;In the excitement of the
      occasion, she appears to have entirely forgotten our poor German lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which case the decision as to place rests with you!&rdquo; resumed Lewis
      eagerly; &ldquo;the matter is therefore settled&mdash;you <i>will</i> come.&rdquo; The
      accent upon the &ldquo;<i>will</i>&rdquo; was intended to be one of entreaty, but
      somehow the tone in which it was uttered partook largely of command, and
      Annie, as she obeyed, said with a smile&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather, I <i>must</i> come&mdash;that is clearly your meaning, Mr.
      Arundel; however, I see Walter and Faust are already <i>en position</i>,
      and I will not set them an example of disobedience, so if you can find the
      books, I will join you immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>

      It was, as Lewis had declared, a lovely evening; the sky was of that deep,
      clear blue which indicates a continuance of fine weather, a soft breeze
      sighed through the blossoms of the lime-tree beneath which they sat. Faust
      lay at Annie&rsquo;s feet, gazing up into her face as though he loved to look
      upon her beauty, which perhaps he did, for Faust was a dog of taste, and
      particular in the selection of his favourites. Walter, stretched at his
      length upon the turf, was idly turning over the pages of a volume of
      coloured prints. Lewis opened the work they were translating; it was that
      loveliest of historical tragedies, Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Piccolomini,&rdquo; and Annie
      read of Max, the simple, the true, the noble-hearted, and thought that the
      world contained but one parallel character, and that he was beside her.
      They read on beneath the summer sky, and tracing the workings of
      Schiller&rsquo;s master mind, forgot all sublunary things in the absorbing
      interest of the story. The scene they were perusing was that in which Max
      Piccolomini describes the chilling effect produced upon him when he for
      the first time beholds Thekla surrounded by the splendours of her father&rsquo;s
      court, and says (I quote Coleridge&rsquo;s beautiful translation for the benefit
      of my <i>un-German</i> readers, and in consideration of the shallowness of
      my own acquaintance with the language of the Fatherland)&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Now, once again, I have courage to look on you,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To-day at noon I could not;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The dazzle of the jewels that play&rsquo;d round you
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Hid the belovèd from me.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      This morning when I found you in the circle
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of all your kindred, in your father&rsquo;s arms,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Beheld myself an alien in this circle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh! what an impulse felt I in that moment
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To fall upon his neck and call him father;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But his stern eye o&rsquo;erpower&rsquo;d the swelling passion,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I dared not but be silent&mdash;and those brilliants
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That like a crown of stars enwreath&rsquo;d your brows,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They scared me too&mdash;Oh! wherefore, wherefore should he
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At the first meeting spread, as &rsquo;twere, the ban
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of excommunication round you?&mdash;wherefore
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Dress up the angel for the sacrifice,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And cast upon the light and joyous heart
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The mournful burden of <i>his</i> station? Fitly
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      May love woo love, but such a splendour
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Might none but monarchs venture to approach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis read this speech, the bright, happy look faded from his face, and
      his voice grew deep and stern; there was in the whole scene a strange
      likeness to his own position, which pained him in the extreme, and brought
      back all his most bitter feelings. Engrossing as was this idea when once
      aroused, he could not but observe the unusual degree of taste and energy
      which Annie, who appeared carried away by the interest of the drama,
      infused into her reading, and the tones of her sweet voice did ample
      justice to the friendly, confiding tenderness with which Thekla endeavours
      to console her lover. After her appeal to the Countess Tertsky&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in spirits, wherefore is he not?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He had quite another nature on the journey,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So calm, so bright, so joyous eloquent&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      she turns to Max, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;It was my wish to see you always so,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And never otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie spoke the last words so earnestly that Lewis involuntarily glanced
      at her, and their eyes met. It was one of those moments which occur twice
      or thrice in a lifetime, when heart reads heart, as an open book, and
      sympathetic thought reveals itself unaided by that weak interpreter the
      tongue. Through weary years of sorrow and separation that look was
      unforgotten by either of them; and when Annie bent her eyes on the ground
      with a slight blush, confessing that the large amount of womanly
      tenderness which she fain would show was not unmingled with a portion of
      womanly love which she would as fain conceal, and Lewis dared not trust
      himself to speak lest the burning thoughts which crowded on his brain
      should force themselves an utterance, neither of them was sorry to
      perceive the figure of Aunt Martha rustling crisply through the stillness,
      as, burthened with boluses, Minerva appeared before them, to give a
      triumphant account of her victory over Tommy Crudle&rsquo;s catarrhal affection,
      of which ailment she promised Annie a reversion for her imprudence in
      sitting out of doors without a bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lewis retired to his room that night he sat down to think over in
      solitude the occurrences of the day. Had he been deceiving himself, then?
      was his unhappy attachment still unsubdued&mdash;nay, had it not
      strengthened? under the delusive garb of friendship, had not Annie&rsquo;s
      society become necessary to his happiness? Again&mdash;and as this idea
      for the first time occurred to him, the strong man trembled like a child
      from the violence of his emotion&mdash;had he not more than this to answer
      for? Selfishly engrossed by his own feelings, madly relying on his own
      strength of will, which he now perceived he had but too good reason to
      mistrust, he had never contemplated the effect his behaviour might produce
      upon a warm-hearted and imaginative girl. Lewis was no coxcomb, but he
      must have wilfully closed his eyes had he not read in Annie&rsquo;s manner that
      morning the fact that she was by no means indifferent to him. True, it
      might be only friendship on her part&mdash;the natural impulse of a
      woman&rsquo;s heart to pity and console one who she perceived to need such
      loving-kindness&mdash;and with this forlorn hope Lewis was fain to content
      himself. Then he strove to form wise resolutions for the future: he would
      avoid her society&mdash;the German lessons should be strictly confined to
      business, and gradually discontinued; and even a vague notion dimly
      presented itself of a time&mdash;say a year thence&mdash;when Walter might
      be entrusted to other hands, and he should be able to extricate himself
      from a situation so fraught with danger. And having thus regarded the
      matter by the light of principle and duty, feeling began to assert its
      claims, and he cursed his bitter fortune, which forced him to avoid one
      whom he would have braved death itself to win. He sat pondering these
      things deep into the night; the sound of the clock over the stables
      striking two at length aroused him from his reverie, and he was about to
      undress, when a slight growl from Faust, who always slept on a mat in
      Lewis&rsquo;s dressing-room, attracted his attention, and as he paused to
      listen, a low whistle, which seemed to proceed from the shrubs under his
      window, caught his ear. Closing the door of the dressing-room to prevent
      Faust from giving any alarm, he walked lightly to the window, which,
      according to his usual custom, he left open all night, and silently
      holding back the curtain, looked out. As he did so a window on the ground
      floor was cautiously opened and the whistle repeated. After a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection he became convinced that the room from which the signal whistle
      had been replied to was occupied by the new butler, who had replaced the
      individual harassed into the desperate step of resigning by Minerva&rsquo;s
      incessant crusades against the Under-the-bed One. At the sound of the
      signal whistle the figures of four men appeared from the shrubs, amongst
      which they had been hidden, and noiselessly approached the window. The
      candle which Lewis had brought upstairs with him had burned out; and
      although his window was open, the curtains were drawn across it; he was
      therefore able, himself unperceived, to see and hear all that was going
      on. As the burglars, for such he did not doubt they were, drew near, the
      following conversation was carried on in a low whisper between their
      leader, a man of unusual stature, and Simmonds the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are late; the plate has been packed and ready for the last two
      hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a light in the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d tutor&rsquo;s room till
      half-an-hour ago,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and we thought he might hear us and
      give the alarm if we did not wait till he was in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not have much signified if he had when you were once in,&rdquo;
       returned Simmonds: &ldquo;the grooms don&rsquo;t sleep in the house; the valet is in
      London; so there&rsquo;s only the tutor, the footman, and the idiot boy, besides
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the old man?&rdquo; inquired the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not returned,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brutal curse was the rejoinder, and the robber continued, &ldquo;The girl is
      safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the tutor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What do you want with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To knock out his &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d brains, and take her with
      us,&rdquo; was the alarming reply. Simmonds appeared to remonstrate, for the
      robber replied in a louder tone than he had yet used&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, <i>yes!</i> Old Grant shall know what it is to lose a
      daughter as well as other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afraid lest the loudness of his voice should give the alarm, the other
      exclaimed in an anxious whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! come in;&rdquo; and one after the other the four men entered by the open
      window.

      CHAPTER XLVII.&mdash;CONTAINS A &ldquo;MIDNIGHT STRUGGLE,&rdquo; GARNISHED WITH A DUE
      AMOUNT OF BLOODSHED, AND OTHER NECESSARY HORRORS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ewis, having
      overheard the conversation detailed in the preceding chapter, perceived
      himself to be placed in a position alike dangerous and difficult. In the
      spokesman and leader of the party he had recognised (as the reader has
      probably also done) his old antagonist, Hardy the poacher. The matter then
      stood thus: four ruffians (one of whom, burning with the desire of revenge
      for wrongs real and supposed, possessed strength and resolution equal to
      his animosity) were already in possession of the lower part of the house,
      their avowed objects being robbery, murder, and abduction; the butler,
      faithless to his trust, was clearly an accomplice; Hardy, fighting as it
      were with a halter round his neck, was not likely to stick at trifles, and
      Lewis foresaw that the conflict, once begun, would be for life or death,
      and on its successful issue depended Annie&rsquo;s rescue from a fate worse than
      death. His only ally was the footman; and whether this lad&rsquo;s courage would
      desert him when he discovered the odds against which he had to contend was
      a point more than doubtful. However, there was no time to deliberate;
      Lewis felt that he must act, and summoning all the energies of his nature
      to meet so fearful an emergency, he prepared to sell his life as dearly as
      possible. On attempting to unlock his pistol case the key turned with
      difficulty, and it was not without some trouble and delay that he was
      enabled to open it. As he did so, it occurred to him that his pistols,
      which he kept loaded, might have been tampered with. It was fortunate that
      he thought of ascertaining this, for on inserting the ramrod he found the
      bullets had been withdrawn from both barrels. Carefully reloading them, he
      placed the pistols in a breast-pocket ready for use, and taking down from
      a nail on which it hung a cavalry sabre which had belonged to Captain
      Arundel, he unsheathed it, and grasping it firmly with his right hand, he
      turned to leave the room, with the design of arousing the footman. As he
      did so a faint tap was heard, and on opening the door the figure of Annie
      Grant, pale and trembling, wrapped in a dressing-gown and shawl, appeared
      before him, while her French <i>soubrette</i>, in an agony of fear, was
      leaning against the wall listening (with eyes that appeared ready to start
      out of her head with fright) for every sound below. As Lewis advanced
      Annie perceived the sabre, and pointing towards it, she exclaimed in an
      agitated whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you have heard them, then! what will become of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis took her trembling hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself,&rdquo; he said in the same low tone; &ldquo;I will defend you, and if
      needs be, die for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words, spoken slowly and earnestly, appeared to act like a charm upon
      her. She became at once composed, and looking up in his face with an
      expression of childlike trust, inquired&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to your apartment and pray for my success; God is merciful, and
      will not turn a deaf ear to such angel pleadings,&rdquo; was the solemn reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie again gazed earnestly at him, and reading in the stern resolution of
      his features the imminence of their danger, was turning away with a
      sickening feeling of despair at her heart, when Lewis again addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to awaken the man-servant,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the butler is an
      accomplice of these scoundrels, and has admitted them. They cannot,
      however, molest you without ascending the stairs, and as they do that I
      shall encounter them; the result is in the hands of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to leave her, but there was a speechless misery in her face
      as she gazed upon him which he could not resist. In an instant he was by
      her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Annie,&rdquo; he said, and his deep tones faltered from the intensity of
      his emotion&mdash;<i>it was the first time he had ever called her by her
      Christian name</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Annie, do not look at me thus sorrowfully;
      it is true we are in peril, but I have ere now braved greater danger than
      this successfully, and&mdash;should I fall, life has few charms for me&mdash;to
      die for you&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the sound of a man&rsquo;s voice in anger was heard from the
      lower part of the house, and starting forward with a scarcely suppressed
      cry of terror, the French girl seized Lewis&rsquo;s arm, while, pointing in the
      direction of the footman&rsquo;s room, she exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Allez, allez, cherchez vite du secours, nous allons être assassinés
      tous</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis placed his finger on his lips in token of silence, and listened a
      moment as the voices below were again audible and then died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are quarrelling over their booty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and are too well
      occupied to think of us at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then led Annie to the door of her room, urged her to fasten it on the
      inside, and pressing her hand warmly, left her. After one or two futile
      attempts he discovered the man-servant&rsquo;s apartment; the door was
      unfastened, and he pushed it open, when the loud, regular breathing which
      met his ear proved that the person of whom he was in search was as yet
      undisturbed. Approaching the bed, Lewis paused for a moment, and shading
      the light with his hand, gazed upon the face of the sleeper. He was
      scarcely beyond the age of boyhood, and his features presented more
      delicacy of form than is usually to be met with in the class to which he
      belonged. He was sleeping as quietly as a child; while Lewis watched him,
      he murmured some inarticulate sounds, and a smile played about his mouth.
      As Lewis stooped to wake him, he could not but mentally contrast the calm
      sleep from which he was arousing him with the probable scene of violence
      and danger in which he would so soon be engaged. It was no time for such
      reflections, however, and laying his hand on the lad&rsquo;s shoulder, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert, you are wanted, rouse up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Startled by the apparition of a tall figure bending over him, the young
      man sprang up, exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? who is it?&rdquo; then recognising Lewis, he continued, &ldquo;Mr.
      Arundel! is anybody ill, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;get up and put on your clothes as quickly as
      possible; there are thieves in the house. I will wait at the top of the
      stairs till you join me; but make no noise, or you may bring them upon us
      before we are prepared for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he quitted the room. In less time than he had imagined it
      possible, the young servant joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you roused Mr. Simmonds?&rdquo; was his first query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The butler has proved unworthy of the trust reposed in him,&rdquo; returned
      Lewis; &ldquo;he has admitted these men into the house, and they are now in his
      pantry, preparing to carry off the plate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke his companion&rsquo;s colour rose, and with flashing eyes he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Let us go down and prevent them; there&rsquo;s plate worth £500
      under his care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis held the lamp so that it shed its light upon the young man&rsquo;s face
      and figure. He was a tall, well-grown youth, and his broad shoulders and
      muscular arms gave promise of strength; his eye was keen and bright, and
      an expression of honest indignation imparted firmness to his mouth. Lewis
      felt that he might be relied on, and determined to trust him accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have worse designs than merely stealing the plate,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they
      intend to carry off Miss Grant, and murder me. Chance enabled me to
      overhear their plan; I mean, therefore, to wait at the top of the stairs
      and use <i>any</i> means to prevent their ascending them: will you stand
      by me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that I will; a man can but die once,&rdquo; was the spirited reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis grasped his hand and shook it warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a brave fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if we succeed in beating off these
      scoundrels, it shall not be my fault if your fortune is not made. There is
      a carabine hanging in the General&rsquo;s bedroom, is there not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Receiving an answer in the affirmative, Lewis continued, &ldquo;Fetch it, then,
      and the sword with it, if you think you can use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Robert departed on this mission, Lewis, surprised at the delay on the
      part of Hardy and his associates, glided lightly down the staircase to
      reconnoitre their proceedings. The lower part of the house was of course
      in total darkness; but as he approached the butler&rsquo;s pantry a bright
      stream of light issued from a crack in the door, while the tramp of nailed
      shoes on the stone flooring inside, together with an occasional muttered
      word or oath from one of the party, proved that they were busily engaged
      in some toilsome occupation, which Lewis rightly conjectured to be
      conveying the plate to a cart outside. Returning as cautiously as he had
      advanced, Lewis rejoined his companion, whom he found waiting for him at
      the top of the stairs, carabine in hand. Having ascertained that the
      charge had been removed from this also, he reloaded it with some of the
      slugs intended for his pistols, and placing the lamp so that it cast its
      light down the staircase, leaving the spot where they stood in shade, he
      handed one pistol to Robert, reserving the other for his own use in any
      emergency which might occur; and thus prepared they awaited the approach
      of the robbers. Their patience was not in this instance destined to be
      severely taxed, for scarcely had they taken their stations when the
      creaking of a door cautiously opened, and the tread of muffled footsteps
      announced that the crisis was at hand; and in another moment Hardy and his
      associates were seen stealthily advancing towards the foot of the stairs.
      As they perceived the light of Lewis&rsquo;s lamp they paused, and a whispered
      consultation took place. At this moment the rays fell strongly upon the
      upper part of the poacher&rsquo;s figure, and Lewis, levelling his carabine,
      could have shot him through the heart. It was a strong temptation. Hardy
      once dead, Lewis had little fear of being able to overcome or intimidate
      the others. He knew that it was life for life, and that by all laws, human
      and divine, the act would be a justifiable one; but he could not bring
      himself to slay a fellow-creature in cold blood. Besides, although since
      his unmanly attack on Annie, Lewis had felt in the highest degree
      irritated against the poacher, he compassionated him for the loss of his
      daughter, and could not entirely divest himself of a species of admiration
      for his strength and daring: so, though he still held the carabine
      directed towards the group, he did not pull the trigger; and thus, by a
      strange turn of fate, Lewis spared Hardy&rsquo;s life, as Hardy had on a former
      occasion spared his, when the motion of a finger would have sent him to
      his long account. At this moment the butler joined the party, and Lewis
      caught the words, &ldquo;They have fire-arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; was the reply in the tones of Simmonds&rsquo; voice, &ldquo;they may
      bark, but they won&rsquo;t bite; I&rsquo;ve taken care of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; exclaimed Hardy impetuously; &ldquo;let us rush at them
      together and overpower them;&rdquo; and grasping a bludgeon with one hand, while
      in the other he held a cocked pistol, he dashed upstairs followed by his
      accomplices. Lewis waited till they had passed a turn in the staircase,
      and then aiming low, in order if possible to stop their advance without
      destroying life, he fired. Simmonds, who was one of the foremost,
      immediately fell, and losing his balance, rolled down several steps; one
      of the others paused in his career, and from his limping gait was
      evidently wounded; but Hardy and two more continued their course
      uninjured. The smoke of the discharge for a moment concealed Lewis&rsquo;s
      figure; as it cleared away, Hardy levelled his pistol at him and fired.
      The bullet whistled by Lewis&rsquo;s ear, and passing within an inch of his
      right temple, lodged in the wall behind him; while, following up his
      ineffectual shot, the robber rushed upon him. Lewis, however, had too keen
      a recollection of his antagonist&rsquo;s matchless strength to risk the chance
      of allowing him to close with him, and springing back, he struck him,
      quick as lightning, two blows with the sabre&mdash;the first on his arm,
      which he raised to protect his head, the second and most severe one on the
      shoulder near the neck: this last blow staggered him, and reeling dizzily,
      he grasped the banister for support, the blood trickling from the wound in
      his shoulder. In the meantime the two others, one of them having felled
      the young footman to the ground by a back-handed stroke with a bludgeon,
      attacked Lewis simultaneously. Having parried one or two blows with his
      sabre, Lewis made a desperate cut at the head of the man with the
      bludgeon. The fellow raised his staff to ward off the stroke, and the blow
      fell upon the oak sapling, which it severed like a reed; but unfortunately
      the shock was too great, and the sword snapped near the hilt. Seeing that
      he was thus left defenceless, and might probably be overpowered, as both
      his assailants were strong, square-built fellows, Lewis had no resource
      but to draw his pistol; and, as before, endeavouring to aim so as to
      disable without destroying life, he fired, and the man nearest to him
      fell. His comrade immediately threw himself upon the young tutor, and a
      fierce struggle ensued. In point of strength the combatants were very
      equally matched; but, fortunately for the result, Lewis was the most
      active, and by a sudden wrench disengaging himself from his antagonist&rsquo;s
      grasp, he struck him a tremendous blow with his clenched fist on the side
      of the head, which sent him down with the force of a battering-ram. As he
      did so a giant arm was thrown round his waist, a knife gleamed at his
      throat, and in a hoarse, broken voice, the savage ferocity of which had
      something appalling in its tones, Hardy exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve owed you something a long time, young feller; and now I&rsquo;ve got a
      chance, I&rsquo;m going to pay you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both his hands being occupied, he, with the fury of some beast of prey,
      seized Lewis&rsquo;s hair with his teeth, and endeavoured to draw his head back
      in order to cut his throat; but, by dint of struggling, Lewis had
      contrived to get his right arm free, and grasping the wrist of the hand
      which held the weapon, he was enabled, as long as his strength might hold
      out, to prevent the ruffian from executing his murderous purpose. Hardy
      made one or two efforts to shake off the grasp which thus fettered him,
      but his muscular power was so much impaired by the sabre cut on the arm
      that he was unable to accomplish his design. Accordingly, trusting to his
      great strength, and thinking that Lewis would become exhausted by his
      attempts to free himself, Hardy determined to wait rather than run the
      risk of affording his victim a chance of escape by removing the arm which
      encircled him. While affairs were in this position, Robert, having
      recovered the stunning effects of the blow which had felled him, regained
      his feet, and was advancing to Lewis&rsquo;s assistance when the robber who had
      been slightly wounded in the leg as he was ascending the stairs, and had
      since remained a passive spectator of the struggle, interposed, and
      rousing, through the medium of a kick in the ribs, the fellow whom Lewis
      had knocked down, closed with the young servant, and attempted to wrench
      the pistol (which went off in the scuffle without injuring any one) from
      his grasp, while his accomplice, gathering himself slowly from the floor,
      prepared to assist him. In the meantime the struggle between Lewis and
      Hardy appeared likely to terminate in favour of the young tutor, for the
      exertions made by the poacher to retain his captive caused the blood to
      flow rapidly from his wounds, and a sensation of faintness stole over him
      which threatened momentarily to incapacitate him. As he became aware of
      this fact his fury and disappointment knew no bounds; and collecting his
      powers for one final effort, he released Lewis&rsquo;s waist, and transferring
      his grasp to his coat collar, suddenly flung his whole weight upon him and
      bore him heavily to the ground; then raising himself and planting his knee
      on Lewis&rsquo;s chest, he stretched out his hand to pick up the knife which he
      had dropped in this last attack. Had he made the attempt one minute
      sooner, it would have been successful, and Lewis would indeed have laid
      down his life for her he loved; but his time was not yet come. As the
      poacher leant over to reach the knife, a dizzy faintness overpowered him,
      his brain reeled; a slight effort on Lewis&rsquo;s part was sufficient to
      dislodge him, and uttering a hollow groan, he rolled over on his back and
      lay motionless, his deep, laboured breathing alone testifying that he was
      still alive. Hastily springing from the ground, Lewis, on regaining his
      feet, turned to assist his companion, who was still manfully battling with
      his two assailants: as he did so the sound of feet became audible, and the
      gardener and three of the other outdoor servants, aroused by the report of
      fire-arms, rushed in, having effected their entrance by the open window of
      the pantry. Their arrival ended the affair. The burglar who was uninjured,
      finding the door of Lewis&rsquo;s bedroom open, took refuge there, leaped from
      the window, alighted on some shrubs, which broke his fall, and the
      darkness favouring him, effected his escape. The other four, who were all
      wounded more or less seriously, were secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      A surgeon was immediately sent for: he examined Hardy (who remained in a
      state of unconsciousness) first. He pronounced the cut in the arm of
      little consequence, but the wound in the neck had divided several
      important vessels, and he considered it highly dangerous. The burglar at
      whom Lewis had discharged his pistol was severely wounded in the hip, but
      the surgeon did not apprehend any serious consequences. Simmonds, the
      butler, proved to have been hit in the knee by a slug from the carabine,
      an injury which would probably lame him for life. The remaining member of
      the gang had come off more easily, a shot having passed through the fleshy
      part of the leg; Robert, the servant, displayed a broken head; and Lewis,
      besides being severely bruised, had in the last struggle with Hardy
      received a wound in the left wrist from the point of the ruffian&rsquo;s knife.
      As soon as, by the application of proper restoratives, Hardy became
      sufficiently recovered to bear removal, a carriage was sent for, and the
      captured burglars were conveyed to the nearest town; the two most severely
      injured were taken to the hospital, and the other pair securely lodged in
      the county gaol.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Annie&rsquo;s expressions of gratitude to her preservers, or on the feelings
      with which Lewis heard her lips pronounce his praises, we will not dwell,
      neither will we expatiate on the view Miss Livingstone (who appeared in a
      tremendous nightcap of cast-iron white-washed, and a dressing-gown of
      Portland stone) was pleased to take of the affair, in which she recognised
      a vindication of the reality of the individual who was always under the
      beds <i>and</i> behind the curtains, who for the future she declared to
      have been Hardy, professing herself able to swear to the expression of his
      boots in any court of justice throughout the United Kingdom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII.&mdash;WHEREIN THE READER DIVERGES INTO A NEW BRANCH OF
      &ldquo;THE RAILROAD OF LIFE&rdquo; IN A THIRD-CLASS CARRIAGE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ewis, bruised and
      wearied after his skirmish with the housebreakers, flung himself on a sofa
      in his dressing-room, to try if he could obtain a few hours&rsquo; sleep ere
      fresh cares and duties should devolve upon him; but sleep demands a calm
      frame of mind, and in his spirit there was no peace. One thought haunted
      him&mdash;in his brief and agitating interview with Annie, had he betrayed
      himself? Sometimes, as he recalled the words he had spoken, and the
      feelings which had as it were forced them from him, he felt that he must
      have done so; and then he regretted that Hardy&rsquo;s bullet had flown wide of
      its mark, and wished that he were lying there a senseless corpse rather
      than a living man endowed with power to feel, and therefore to suffer.
      Then he bethought him how alarmed and confused Annie had appeared, and he
      conceived that she might have been too thoroughly preoccupied and
      self-engrossed to have marked his words, or to have attributed to them any
      meaning save friendly interest. One thing was only too clear: of whatever
      nature might be Annie&rsquo;s feelings towards him, his affection for her was
      love&mdash;deep, fervent, earnest love&mdash;a passion that he could
      neither banish nor control. How then should he act? flight had now become
      the idea that most readily occurred to him: again, the possibility of
      leaving Walter presented itself to his mind, and this time not as a mere
      remote contingency, but as a step which he might at any moment be called
      upon to take, if he could not recover his selfcontrol so entirely as to
      endure Annie&rsquo;s presence; nay, to receive marks of her gratitude and
      esteem, or even, on occasion, to share her confidence, without betraying
      his feelings. Then in his self-tormenting he caught at the expression
      which he had half thought, half uttered, to &ldquo;<i>endure</i>&rdquo; her presence&mdash;to
      endure that which he idolised, the presence of one for whom he would
      sacrifice friends, family, the love of adventure, his ambitious hopes,
      nay, as he had but now proved, life itself. A wild idea crossed his mind:
      if love were thus all-powerful with him, a strong-minded, determined man,
      might it not be equally so with her, a young, impulsive girl, whose very
      nature was an embodiment of tenderness; might she not secretly pine to
      sacrifice rank, station, riches, for the sake of love and him? Sacrifice&mdash;ay,
      rather rejoice to cast off such trammels! Should he strive to ascertain
      this? Should he tell her how he loved her with a passion that was
      undermining the secret springs of his very existence, and implore her to
      fly with him to some fair western land, where the false distinctions of
      society were undreamed of, and the brave, true-hearted man was lord, not
      of his servile fellows, but of the creation which God had destined him to
      rule? The picture, seen by the false glare of his heated imagination,
      appeared a bright one, the lights stood out boldly, and the shadows
      remained unheeded till the first gleam of returning reason brought them
      prominently forward, and he shuddered to think that he could have
      entertained for a moment a project so completely at variance with every
      principle of honour and of duty. Thus feverish alike in mind and body, he
      tossed restlessly on his couch, till at length, thoroughly exhausted, he
      fell into a deep sleep, and dreamed bright dreams of happy love, to make
      the stern reality appear yet darker and more drear on waking.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to Broadhirst, General Grant expressed his most unqualified
      admiration at the gallant defence of his house, property, and daughter (we
      quote his own &ldquo;table of precedence&rdquo;) by Lewis and the man-servant. On the
      former he bestowed a sword (presented to him in bygone days by some Indian
      potentate) to replace the weapon broken in the struggle, together with a
      handsomely-bound copy of the &ldquo;Wellington Despatches&rdquo;; the latter he
      rewarded by promotion to the post of butler, <i>vice</i> Simmonds (in a
      fair way to be) transported, together with a douceur of twenty pounds;
      which piece of good fortune so elated the youthful Robert that he publicly
      declared he should like to have his head broken every night, and wished
      the house might be robbed regularly twice a week till further orders. The
      wounded men recovered rapidly, with the exception of Hardy, whose case
      assumed a very alarming character: owing to the state of his constitution,
      impaired by a course of intemperance, to which, since his escape from
      prison, he had given himself over, erysipelas supervened, and in a few
      days his life was despaired of. On receiving this intelligence Lewis rode
      over to H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and calling at the hospital,
      requested to be allowed to see the man whose life he had been the
      involuntary instrument of shortening. The permission was readily accorded,
      and he was conducted along several passages to the room, or rather cell,
      for it was little else, in which, for the purpose of security as well as
      to separate him from the other inmates of the establishment, the burglar
      had been placed. As soon as Lewis had entered the door was closed and
      fastened on the outside. Noiselessly approaching the truckle bed on which
      Hardy lay, the young tutor paused as his glance fell upon the prostrate
      figure of his former antagonist. Stretched at full length upon the couch,
      his arm and shoulder swathed in bandages, and his muscular throat and
      broad, hairy chest partially uncovered, he looked even more gigantic than
      when in an erect posture: his face was pale as death, and an unnatural
      darkness beneath the skin betokened to any one accustomed to such
      appearances the speedy approach of the destroyer; while a small hectic
      spot of colour on the centre of each cheek gave evidence of the inward
      fever which was consuming him. When Lewis approached the bed his eyes were
      closed, and his deep breathing at first led to the belief that he was
      asleep; that this was not the case, however, soon became apparent. Opening
      his eyes, he accidentally encountered those of Lewis fixed upon him with
      an expression of mingled pity and remorse: as their glances met Hardy gave
      a start of surprise, and gazed at him with a scowl which proved that his
      feelings of animosity against Lewis were still unabated; while a puzzled
      look evinced that his mental powers were so much weakened that he doubted
      whether the figure he beheld were real or a creation of his morbid fancy.
      Advancing to the bedside, Lewis broke the silence by inquiring whether he
      suffered much pain. As he began to speak, the confused look disappeared
      from the sick man&rsquo;s countenance, and glaring at him with an expression of
      impotent rage, he exclaimed in a low, hoarse voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re come to look upon your handiwork, are you? I hope you like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to tell you that I am sorry the blows I struck you in
      self-defence should have produced such disastrous consequences, and to ask
      your forgiveness, in case the means employed for your restoration to
      health should prove ineffectual,&rdquo; replied Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Restore my health!&rdquo; repeated Hardy bitterly. &ldquo;Do you mean that you expect
      these doctors can cure me? Do you think these wounds, that burn like
      hell-fire, can be healed by their plasters and bandages? I tell you no!
      You have done your work effectually this time, and I am a dying man. You
      want me to forgive you, do you? If my curse could wither you where you
      stand, I would and <i>do</i> curse you! If priests&rsquo; tales be true, and
      there be a heaven and a hell, and by forgiving you I could reach heaven, I
      still would curse you, in the hope that by so doing I might drag you down
      to hell with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vehemence with which he uttered this malediction completely exhausted
      him, and falling back on the pillow he lay with closed eyes, his laboured
      breathing affording the only proof that he was still alive. Throwing
      himself upon a chair by the bedside, Lewis sat wrapped in painful thought.
      The reflection that hatred to him for acts which circumstances had forced
      him to commit might cause the unhappy being before him to die impenitent,
      and that he might thus be instrumental to the destruction both ot his body
      and soul, was distressing to him in the extreme; and yet how to bring him
      to a better frame of mind was not easy to decide. At length, following out
      his own train of thought, he asked abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardy, why do you hate me so bitterly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus accosted, the poacher unclosed his eyes, and fixed them with a
      piercing glance upon the face of his questioner, as though he would read
      his very soul. Apparently disappointed in his object, for Lewis met his
      gaze with the calm self-possession of conscious rectitude, he answered
      surlily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you come here to torment me with foolish questions? It is enough
      that I hate you with just cause&mdash;and you know that it is so. I hate
      you now, I shall hate you dying, and I shall hate you after death, if
      there is a hereafter. Now go. If by staying here you think to persuade or
      entrap me into saying I forgive you, you only waste your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Hardy,&rdquo; returned Lewis, speaking calmly and impressively.
      &ldquo;You are, as you truly say, a dying man. In this life we shall probably
      never meet again. The reality of a future life you appear to doubt: I
      believe in it; and I believe that your condition there may be affected by
      your dying with such feelings in your heart as you have now expressed. It
      is therefore worth while to discuss this matter, and see whether you have
      such just cause to hate me as you imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Hardy made no reply, Lewis continued: &ldquo;It is true that on a former
      occasion I secured your capture when perhaps I was stepping beyond my
      regular path of duty to do so; but in this last affair I merely acted in
      self-defence, as I overheard from my open window your scheme for my
      destruction. You discharged a pistol at me ere I attacked you: had the
      ball gone half an inch more to the right I should have been a dead man.
      Whatever may be your faults, you are brave; and that quality alone should
      prevent your bearing malice against one who met you in fair, open fight.
      It was a game for life and death, and it is unjust to hate me for winning
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy, you will madden me,&rdquo; exclaimed Hardy passionately, raising himself
      on his elbow as he spoke, though the pain the action caused him forced a
      groan from his compressed lips. &ldquo;Do you suppose I care for your paltry
      blows? If they had not finished me, brandy or my own hand would soon have
      done so; for life has long been a curse to me, and had become unbearable
      since&mdash;may the torments I shall soon endure, if there be a hell, fall
      upon you for it!&mdash;since you and the titled scoundrel, your
      accomplice, stole my daughter from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis in astonishment. &ldquo;Do you imagine me to have had any
      share in that wickedness? Why, man, I never saw your daughter save on two
      occasions; and on the second of these I warned her&mdash;unfortunately
      without effect&mdash;against the designs of the villain who betrayed her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke Hardy gazed eagerly at him, and when he ceased, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me when and where was it that you did this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on the morning after the electioneering ball at Broadhurst. I was
      shooting with the gamekeeper&mdash;met your daughter by accident in the
      grass field by the larch plantation&mdash;and witnessing her parting with
      Lord Bellefield, I took the opportunity of telling her his true name and
      character, and warning her against his probable designs. But, unluckily,
      she had observed a disagreement between us on the previous evening, and
      supposing me to be actuated by malicious motives, discredited my
      assertion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not deceiving me?&rdquo; questioned Hardy eagerly. &ldquo;You could not, dare
      not, do so now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know me, or you would not doubt my word. I have spoken the
      simple truth,&rdquo; returned Lewis coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; continued Hardy, producing from beneath the pillow a small Bible
      which the chaplain had left with him: &ldquo;you tell me you believe in this
      book. Will you swear upon it that you are not trying to deceive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis raised the book reverently to his lips, and kissing it, took the
      required oath. Hardy watched him with a scrutinising gaze, and when he had
      concluded, held out his hand, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wronged you deeply, Mr. Arundel, and must ask&mdash;what! never
      thought again to ask at the hand of man&mdash;your forgiveness. I have
      sought your life, sir, as the wild beast seeks his prey; and chance, on
      one occasion, and your own courage and address on others, have alone
      preserved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then went on to relate how, his suspicions having been excited by hints
      from the neighbours, he had learned that his daughter was in the habit of
      meeting some gentleman by stealth. How he watched for this person
      constantly, without success, till the day after the great party at
      Broadhurst, when, lying concealed in the larch plantation, he had been
      attracted by the sound of voices, and creeping beneath the underwood, had
      witnessed, though not near enough to overhear what passed, the interview
      between Lewis and his daughter, when he naturally concluded the young
      tutor to be the individual against whom he had been cautioned. He then
      went on to relate that the opportune arrival of the gamekeeper had alone
      prevented him from shooting the supposed libertine, but that he had
      determined on his destruction, and that his subsequent capture by Lewis
      and the General had alone hindered him from executing his design. It was
      not till after his escape from H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; gaol that he
      first heard Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s name coupled with that of his daughter,
      which information complicated the affair; but still feeling convinced that
      Lewis was guilty, either as principal or accessory, he joined in the
      scheme for robbing Broadhurst, in order to be revenged on the young tutor,
      as well as on General Grant, against whom he had long nourished feelings
      of animosity, on account of his poaching persecutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      His penitence for the wrong he had done him by his unjust suspicions were
      so sincere and spontaneous, that Lewis imagined he recognised, amid the
      ruin of a naturally generous disposition, that &ldquo;seed of the soul&rdquo; which
      remains in almost every nature, however the rank growth of evil passions
      uncontrolled may have checked its development. Taking advantage of an
      expression which Hardy used, that &ldquo;he thanked God he had not added to his
      other sins the murder of one who had sought to befriend his child,&rdquo; his
      companion observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you thank God for preserving you from an additional crime: now,
      does not the fact of your involuntarily making use of that form of speech
      tend to convince you that the belief in a God and a future state is
      natural to the mind of man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardy seemed struck by the force of this remark, and Lewis, pursuing the
      subject, had the satisfaction of perceiving that he had excited the
      wounded man&rsquo;s interest, and ere he quitted him he obtained his promise to
      listen to the exhortations of the chaplain, whose advances he had hitherto
      angrily repulsed. Pleased with the result of his visit, Lewis on his way
      home called upon the clergyman who fulfilled the duties of chaplain to the
      hospital, and mentioning to him Hardy&rsquo;s improved frame of mind, begged him
      to see him again as soon as possible, to which request the chaplain
      willingly acceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after this interview Lewis received a note from this gentleman
      thanking him for his hint, and informing him that its results had been as
      satisfactory as in such a case was possible. Hardy appeared sincerely
      penitent, willing to embrace and anxious to profit by the truths of
      religion, as far as his weakened faculties enabled him to apprehend them.
      He added that he was sinking fast, and had expressed the greatest desire
      to see Lewis again before he died, as he had some request to make to him.
      On the receipt of this information Lewis immediately set out for H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great alteration had taken place in Hardy&rsquo;s appearance in those three
      days. His cheeks had become still more hollow, the unnatural brightness of
      his eyes was replaced by a dull, leaden look, and the hectic colour had
      faded to the pale, ashy hue of approaching dissolution, whilst the hoarse,
      deep tones of his voice were reduced almost to a whisper through weakness.
      But the most remarkable change was in the expression of his features; the
      sullen scowl, which betokened a spirit at war alike with itself and
      others, had given place to a look of calm resignation; there were indeed
      traces of bodily pain and mental anguish about the mouth, but the upper
      part of the face was in complete repose. Lewis gazed upon him with deep
      interest, and the idea suggested itself that thus might have appeared the
      demoniac when the words of power had gone forth, &ldquo;Hold thy peace, and come
      out of him.&rdquo; Nor was the comparison inapt, for if ever the mind of man was
      possessed by an evil spirit, that of Hardy had been so by the demon of
      revenge. As the dying man perceived his approach his features lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would come, Mr. Arundel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I felt that! should not
      die without seeing you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suffer much pain now, Hardy?&rdquo; inquired Lewis kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely any since six o&rsquo;clock this morning, sir,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but I
      know what that means&mdash;that&rsquo;s mortification coming on. I&rsquo;ve seen men
      die from sabre wounds before now. I was a soldier once&mdash;at least I
      was farrier to a troop of cavalry, which is much the same thing; but this
      was not what I wanted to say to you.&rdquo; He paused from exhaustion, and
      pointed to a glass containing some strengthening cordial. Lewis held it to
      his parched lips; having drunk a portion of it, he appeared considerably
      revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going fast,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;and must not waste the minutes that
      remain. You have treated me with kindness, sir&mdash;one of the few who
      have ever done so; you are a bold foe and a warm-hearted friend, and that
      is a character I understand and can trust. Moreover, you tell me you
      showed poor Jane&rdquo; (as he mentioned his daughter&rsquo;s name tears stood in his
      eyes and his breath came short and fast) &ldquo;her danger, and strove to warn
      her against the villain who has wronged her, and this shows you are a good
      man; therefore I am going to ask you to do me a favour. When I am dead, I
      want you to find out Jane and tell her whatever you may think best to
      induce her to leave this man. And when she hears that I&rsquo;m dead, if she
      seems to feel it very deep and take on about it&mdash;which likely enough
      she will, for she did care for me once&mdash;you may tell her that I
      forgave her before I died. I never thought to do so, for she has finished
      what her mother began; between them they&rsquo;ve first made me the devil I have
      been, and then&mdash;broken my heart.&rdquo; He paused, and when he had
      sufficiently recovered breath, continued, &ldquo;When I married her mother,
      five-and-twenty years ago, I was a different man from whatever you&rsquo;ve
      known me. I&rsquo;d been brought up to my father&rsquo;s trade of a blacksmith, and
      worked steadily at it till I was able to lay by a fair sum of money,
      besides keeping the old man as long as he was alive. However, in the
      village where we lived was a farmer, well-to-do in the world, and his
      daughter was far the prettiest girl in those parts; she&rsquo;d had a good
      education, and gave herself airs like a lady, and looked down upon a rough
      young fellow like me; but I bore it patiently, for I loved her, and
      determined I&rsquo;d never marry anybody but her. For a long time she would not
      look at me, but I persevered; any man that come a-courting her I picked a
      quarrel with and thrashed. I found many ways of making myself handy to the
      old man, her father, and somehow she got used to me like, and grew less
      scornful; and just then a sister of my father&rsquo;s, who had been housekeeper
      at Broadhurst, died and left me £300, and I&rsquo;d saved about £200 more, and
      the old man wanted help to manage his farm. And the long and short of the
      matter was I married Harriet Wylde, took a farm next her father&rsquo;s, and
      gave up blacksmithing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For four years I was as happy as man could be; everything seemed to
      prosper with me. My wife had one child, a girl; a proud man was I when she
      was first placed in my arms, but had I known what was to be her fate I
      would have smothered her in her cradle! There was a young gentleman lived
      near us&mdash;his father was a rich baronet&mdash;I had been accustomed to
      break in horses for the son, and when I took the farm we used to shoot
      together. He was a frank, generous-hearted man, and treated me like a
      friend and equal. On our shooting expeditions he would often come and
      lunch at my house; on one occasion he brought his younger brother with
      him. This young fellow had just returned from Italy, and brought foreign
      manners and foreign vices with him. My wife was still very good-looking,
      like poor Jane, but handsomer; and this heartless villain coveted her
      beauty. I know not what arts he used; I suspected nothing, saw nothing,
      but one evening on my return my home was desolate. I obtained traces of
      the fugitives&mdash;he had taken her to a seaport town in the south of
      England, meaning to embark for France&mdash;I followed them, and in the
      open street I met him; the bystanders interfered between us, or I should
      have slain him where he stood. He was taken to an inn, where he kept his
      bed for some weeks from the effect of the punishment I had administered to
      him. I was dragged off to prison; the law which suffered him to rob me of
      her whom I prized more dearly than house and goods punished me for
      chastising the scoundrel with six months&rsquo; imprisonment. I consorted with
      thieves, poachers, and other refuse of society; and in my madness to
      obtain revenge upon the class which had injured me, I listened to their
      specious arguments till I became the curse to myself and others which you,
      sir, have known me. Well, society sent me to school, and society has had
      the benefit of the lessons that were taught me. I came out of gaol a bad
      and well-nigh a desperate man, to learn that my wife had returned to her
      father&rsquo;s house and died, giving birth to a boy. In my anger I refused to
      acknowledge the child, but the old man took care of it. Time passed on:
      the elder of the two brothers quarrelled with his father and died abroad,
      the younger one married; but God visited him for his sin. His wife saw by
      accident in an old newspaper an account of my trial for the assault; the
      shock brought on a premature confinement; she also died in childbirth, and
      the child remained an idiot. Yes! you start, but you have guessed rightly&mdash;the
      boy to whom you are tutor is the son of the man who wronged me. The ways
      of God are very wonderful: had the boy possessed his proper senses you
      might never have come here, and I might not now be lying on my death-bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Hardy broke off from weakness, and again Lewis administered the
      cordial to him and wiped the cold dews from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little more remains to tell,&rdquo; he added after a few minutes&rsquo; pause; &ldquo;and
      &rsquo;tis well that it is so, for death comes on apace. I do not fear to
      die; I have long wished myself dead, life was such deep misery, yet now I
      should be glad to live, that I might undo some of the evil I have caused.
      Since I saw you last I have felt more like my former self than I have ever
      done from the time my wife left me. Poor Harriet! Do you think we shall
      meet in the world of spirits, Mr. Arundel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are things God alone knows,&rdquo; replied Lewis gravely. &ldquo;He has not
      seen fit to reveal to living man the secrets of the grave!&rdquo; After a short
      silence, in which Hardy appeared to be collecting strength to finish his
      relation, he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After my release from the prison I took to drinking to banish reflection.
      Drinking is a vice which brings all others in its train. I soon fell into
      bad company, became involved in debt; and at last, in a drunken fit,
      enlisted in the&mdash;&mdash;th Dragoons, my height attracting the notice
      of a recruiting party from that regiment. I served ten years, at the end
      of which time my wife&rsquo;s father died and left his little property between
      the two children, with the exception of a sum to purchase my discharge if
      I chose to come and take care of them. The confinement and regularity of a
      soldier&rsquo;s life did not suit me, and I availed myself of the opportunity
      thus offered, returned home, and lived on a certain income set apart for
      the maintenance and education of the children. This was a fresh chance for
      me, and had I conducted myself properly I might have yet known some
      peaceful years; but a craving for excitement haunted me. I sought out some
      of my old companions, joined a Chartist association, took to habits of
      poaching&mdash;and this has been the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of the boy who was left to your care?&rdquo; inquired Lewis. Hardy
      uttered a low groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is another sin I have to answer for,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never liked the
      child&mdash;I doubted whether it was mine, and the sight of it recalled
      the memory of my wrongs; accordingly, I treated the boy harshly, and he
      repaid me by sullen disobedience; and yet there should have been sympathy
      between us. He was brave even to rashness, and copied my vices with an
      aptitude which proved his power of acquiring better things. By the time he
      was thirteen he could set a snare, hit a bird on the wing, thrash any boy
      of his own weight, and alas! drink, game, and swear as well as I could
      myself. One night I had been drinking he angered me, and in my rage I
      struck him. For a moment he looked as if he would return the blow; but the
      folly of such an attempt seemed to occur to him, and he glanced towards a
      knife which lay on the table; then his sister threw her arms round him,
      and he refrained. He waited till she had gone to bed, sitting sulkily
      without speaking. When we were alone he looked up and asked me abruptly,
      &lsquo;Father, are you sorry that you struck me that blow?&rsquo; There was something
      in the boy&rsquo;s manner that appealed to my better feelings, and I was half
      inclined to own myself wrong, but a false shame prevented me, and I
      angrily replied &lsquo;that I would repeat the blow if he gave me any more of
      his impertinence.&rsquo; He looked sternly at me, and muttering, &lsquo;That you shall
      never do,&rsquo; quitted the room. From that day to this I have never seen him.
      My poor Jane, who was dotingly fond of him, was broken-hearted at his
      loss. She told me he often threatened to run away when I had treated him
      harshly, and that his intention was to go to sea. I have no doubt he
      contrived to put it into execution. Perhaps if her brother had remained
      with her the poor girl might not have left her home so readily. God help
      me, my sins have brought their own punishment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An attack of faintness here overpowered him, of so severe a character that
      Lewis thought it advisable to summon assistance. When Hardy had in some
      degree recovered, Lewis, on consulting his watch, found that he must
      return without further delay; he therefore prepared to depart, bidding
      Hardy farewell, and promising to see him again on the following day. The
      dying man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no to-morrow for me in this world,&rdquo; he said; then pressing
      Lewis&rsquo;s hand, he added, &ldquo;God bless you, Mr. Arundel; you have done me more
      good by your kind words than your sword has done me evil; nay, even for my
      death I thank you; for had I lived on as I was I should only have added
      crime to crime. You will remember your promise about poor Jane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis repeated his willingness to do all in his power to carry out the
      dying man&rsquo;s wishes; and Hardy added, &ldquo;It may be that the poor boy I told
      you of is still alive. If he should ever return, I should like him to know
      that I have often grieved for my bad conduct to him. I have left a letter
      for you with the clergyman in case I had not seen you,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;it
      only contains the request I have now made, and one or two other
      particulars of less consequence; he will give it to you when I am gone.&rdquo;
       He again pressed Lewis&rsquo;s hand feebly, and closing his eyes, lay more dead
      than alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis quitted the room the surgeon met him and informed him that it was
      not probable Hardy would survive through the night, but promised that
      every attention should be bestowed upon him. Lewis&rsquo;s thoughts, as he rode
      back to Broadhurst, naturally ran upon the history of sin and shame and
      sorrow to which he had just listened, and he could not but wonder for what
      purpose a frank, generous nature, such as Hardy had originally possessed,
      should have been so severely tried. A like question may have occurred to
      many of us, and we may have felt that the safest course is to look upon
      such things as mysteries to be regarded by the twilight of a patient
      faith, which waits trustfully till all that now seems dark shall be made
      clear in the glorious brightness of the perfect day.

      CHAPTER XLIX.&mdash;CONTAINS A PARADOX&mdash;LEWIS, WHEN LEAST RESIGNED,
      DISPLAYS THE VIRTUE OF RESIGNATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the morning
      after his second visit to Hardy, Lewis received a packet from the hospital
      chaplain enclosing the letter of which the dying man had spoken, together
      with a note containing the information that Hardy had breathed his last
      about two hours before, daybreak. The chaplain had seen him, and judged
      him to be in a fitting state of mind to receive the last consolations of
      religion. After partaking of the Holy Communion he had fallen into a state
      of unconsciousness, and died without any return of pain. Lewis opened
      Hardy&rsquo;s letter: it merely contained a repetition of the request in regard
      to his unfortunate daughter, together with a reference to one of his
      associates, in whose possession was a packet containing his
      father-in-law&rsquo;s will and other papers, all of which he begged Lewis to
      take charge of and examine at his leisure; he also gave a clue by which
      Miss Grant&rsquo;s watch and trinkets might be recovered, and expressed his deep
      penitence for that robbery, as well as for his other crimes. As Lewis
      perused this letter, he for the first time became more fully aware of the
      embarrassing situation in which he had placed himself by his promise to
      Hardy. How was he to discover Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s victim? how endeavour to
      reclaim her? After a few minutes&rsquo; thought his determination was taken.
      General Grant had announced that morning the fact that Lord Bellefield,
      having accepted an invitation to Broadhurst, might be expected in the
      course of the following day; Lewis therefore resolved to address a letter
      to his lordship, to be given him on his arrival, detailing such portions
      of Hardy&rsquo;s confession as related to his daughter, and the promise which he
      had been thereby induced to make to the dying poacher; adding that if Lord
      Bellefield would afford him the information necessary to enable him to
      carry out her father&rsquo;s wishes, and would pledge his word of honour to
      avoid her for the future, he should not attempt to give publicity to the
      matter, but that in the event of his refusal he should feel it his duty to
      make General Grant acquainted with the whole affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of the system he had laid down for himself, Lewis avoided
      Annie&rsquo;s society as much as was possible; a line of conduct which she soon
      appeared to observe, and at first to wonder at.. The arrival of Lord
      Bellefield, however, and her knowledge of Lewis&rsquo;s feelings towards him,
      afforded her an imaginary clue to the young tutor&rsquo;s altered demeanour;
      still, the change annoyed and pained her more than she chose to
      acknowledge even to her own heart. Lord Belle-field was all amiability; he
      had visited Italy, and brought back innumerable anecdotes of the domestic
      felicity of his brother Charles, whose wife he reported to be a model to
      her sex. His accounts of Charles&rsquo;s prodigious business efforts, varied by
      occasional lapses into the <i>dolce far niente</i> of dandyism, were
      amusing in the extreme Annie was forced to own that her cousin appeared
      greatly improved, and yet her repugnance to a renewal of the engagement
      seemed daily to increase. General Grant, however, by no means sympathised
      with this caprice, as he considered it, and was only restrained from some
      violent manifestation of domestic despotism by his confidence in his own
      authority, and in the certainty of Annie&rsquo;s obedience whenever he might see
      fit to demand it. Lewis wrote the letter to Lord Bellefield, and having
      ascertained that it had reached him safely, waited patiently for an
      answer. Several days elapsed without his receiving one, and he was
      debating what step he should next take, when, as he was pacing up and down
      a shrubbery walk, wrapped in meditation, he suddenly met Lord Bellefield
      face to face. Determining not to lose an opportunity, he raised his hat,
      and bowing slightly, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This meeting is fortunate, as I am anxious to ask your lordship a
      question. Have you not received a letter from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, sir,&rdquo; was the haughty and concise reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is customary between gentlemen to acknowledge the receipt of a
      letter,&rdquo; urged Lewis, &ldquo;more particularly when, as in this instance, the
      writer has pledged himself to act according to the tenor of the answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely see how your observation applies to the present case,&rdquo; was the
      insolent rejoinder. &ldquo;In regard to your letter, I have treated it with the
      silent contempt it merited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s brow flushed; controlling the angry impulse, however, he said
      calmly, &ldquo;Your lordship cannot irritate me by such insinuations&mdash;you
      are aware of the alternative when you refuse to answer my letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sir; you are welcome to take any course you please: I scorn your
      false accusations, and leave you to do your worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case we understand each other,&rdquo; was the stern reply, and again
      raising his hat, Lewis passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this brief conversation he lost no time in obtaining a private
      interview with General Grant; scarcely, however, had he begun his
      statement when the General interrupted him by observing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not trouble you to proceed; Mr. Arundel; I am in possession of all
      the facts you are about to detail&mdash;Lord Bellefield has given me a
      full explanation of the matter, and I can assure you that you are
      labouring under an erroneous impression. The main facts of the story are,
      I am sorry to say, true; but the chief actor in the affair was a rascally
      valet of Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s, who assumed his master&rsquo;s name and apparel in
      order to accomplish his nefarious designs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I myself witnessed an interview between Lord Bellefield and the poor
      girl on the morning after the ball,&rdquo; returned Lewis in surprise; &ldquo;I should
      not have brought such a charge on insufficient grounds, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your zeal, sir,&rdquo; replied the General&mdash;&ldquo;for I am willing to attribute
      the step you have taken solely to misdirected zeal&mdash;has assuredly led
      you into error. Lord Bellefield, who seems by some means aware of this
      idea of yours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned the fact that I had seen him in a letter which I addressed to
      him on the subject,&rdquo; interrupted Lewis. &ldquo;It is only fair when you accuse a
      man of any fault to explain the grounds on which you believe him to have
      committed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, sir, quite right,&rdquo; rejoined the General with an approving
      nod; &ldquo;it is owing to the fair and manly way in which you have stated this
      matter that Lord Bellefield has been enabled to clear himself to my entire
      satisfaction. In regard to the interview to which you refer, he has
      recalled to me the fact that he spent the morning in question almost
      entirely in my company; we were engaged upon matters connected with the
      approaching election&mdash;you must therefore have mistaken the identity
      of the person you imagined to be him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not apt to make such mistakes,&rdquo; replied Lewis dryly, feeling
      convinced that the story was a clever fabrication from beginning to end,
      while, at the same time, he was becoming aware that for him to prove it to
      be so would be next to impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, you must have done so in this instance,&rdquo; resumed General
      Grant; &ldquo;but the mistake is easily to be accounted for. Lord Bellefield
      tells me that in order more safely to carry on his schemes, this rascally
      valet used to disguise himself so as to resemble his master as much as
      possible, even wearing false moustachios to increase the likeness; the
      fact of his having deceived you proves how successfully the fellow had
      contrived his disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the General was speaking, Lewis hastily ran over in his mind all the
      evidence he possessed to prove Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s guilt; and though he
      still felt as deeply convinced as he had ever been that in his first
      impression he had not erred, yet so skilfully had this story of the valet
      been adapted to suit the circumstances of the case that it appeared
      impossible to undeceive a man whose habits of mind were so obstinate as
      those of General Grant. His first introduction to the girl after the glove
      affair in the ice-room, although it carried conviction to his own mind,
      proved nothing, save that having witnessed a quarrel between two
      gentlemen, she was naturally enough alarmed as to the probable
      consequences to which it might lead. Again, in his second interview she
      might have been herself deceived by the valet&rsquo;s representations into
      believing him to be Lord Bellefield, or, as she said, Mr. Leicester, his
      brother; or again, it was still more probable that she had been in her
      lover&rsquo;s confidence, and striving to mystify and deceive Lewis. Hardy might
      have been aware of other facts, but his mistake in regard to Lewis proved
      that his information was not to be relied on. All this Lewis saw at a
      glance; and seeing, felt more annoyed and embarrassed than he could
      express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time will prove the truth,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I cannot believe in Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s innocence, but I am unable, at the present moment, to adduce
      any facts which might not bear the interpretation he has chosen to put
      upon them, and can only express my sorrow at having annoyed you, sir, by
      making a charge which I have failed to substantiate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You annoy me more, Mr. Arundel, by refusing to be convinced by evidence
      which, after having given the matter my fullest attention, has sufficed to
      satisfy me. I can only imagine that in this matter private pique has
      warped your usually clear judgment; perhaps, after a little cool
      reflection, you may be induced to take a more charitable view of the
      affair.&rdquo; So saying, the General stalked out of the room with a majestic
      port, as of an offended lion, leaving Lewis in a frame of mind the reverse
      of seraphic. But his trials for that morning were not yet at an end. Annie
      Grant had brooded over the young tutor&rsquo;s gloomy looks and altered
      demeanour till she had made herself quite unhappy, when the idea occurred
      to her that she herself might be to blame. Since the last German lesson,
      to which allusion has been made, she had felt an instinctive dread of
      sounding the depth of her own feelings, or of allowing any one else, and
      much more Lewis, to perceive them. But it now struck her that in avoiding
      one extreme she had fallen into the other, and that Lewis might conceive
      the alteration in her manner to be owing to Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s influence.
      This notion having once struck her, was so inconceivably painful that she
      determined to avail herself of the first opportunity of inquiring to what
      cause Lewis&rsquo;s estrangement might be attributed; and if she found it had
      been produced by any supposed coolness on her part, she resolved to
      explain away such impression, and as she herself would have termed it,
      &ldquo;make friends&rdquo; again. Pondering these thoughts, she entered the library by
      a door communicating with the garden; in her hand she carried a bunch of
      roses, which she had just gathered, and hanging from her arm was her
      garden bonnet, which she had converted for the occasion into an extempore
      basket, also filled with roses; her golden ringlets, scared from their
      propriety by the wind, hung in picturesque disorder about her face and
      neck; the alarm she had lately undergone had rendered her somewhat paler
      than ordinary, and her delicate features were characterised by an
      unusually pensive expression. She entered so quietly, that Lewis, who,
      buried in thought, was seated at the table, his head resting on his hands,
      did not perceive her presence until, in a soft, low voice, she uttered his
      name. At the moment she spoke he was thinking of her&mdash;striving in
      vain to banish her image, which haunted his imagination like some restless
      ghost&mdash;trying to <i>think down</i> the temptation which was hourly
      becoming too strong for him; and when the sound of her voice reached him,
      and looking up with a start he saw her standing by him in the power of her
      dazzling beauty, it seemed as though the phantom of his imagination had
      suddenly assumed a bodily shape to tempt him beyond all power of
      resistance. Something of all this must have appeared in the expression of
      his features, for Annie began, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Arundel, I had no
      idea of startling you; I fancied you had heard me enter&mdash;but you look
      pale and tremble, surely you are not ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he replied, forcing a smile, &ldquo;it is nothing; a slight giddiness
      which will pass away in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, however, he pressed his hand to his brow, which throbbed as
      though it would burst. Annie became alarmed, and placing her flowers on
      the table, she drew nearer to him, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure there is something the matter; you are either ill or unhappy;
      you have received some bad news of your mother, or dear Rose, is it not
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you are mistaken,&rdquo; returned Lewis, making an effort to rouse
      himself; &ldquo;I was buried in thought, and your sudden entrance startled me. I
      am not usually given to such freaks, but since our nocturnal adventure I
      must confess to having become practically convinced of the existence of
      nerves. I must have lost more blood from this cut in the wrist than I was
      at first aware of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that dreadful night!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie, clasping her hands and turning
      pale at the recollection; &ldquo;I shall never forget all I went through on that
      night if I live to be a hundred. I had been asleep for an hour or more,
      when I suddenly woke and saw Lisette standing by my bedside pale and
      trembling; as soon as she could find voice to speak she told me there were
      robbers in the house, and that we should all be murdered. My first idea
      was that you would be able to save us, and I told her to go and arouse you
      instantly; I soon found, however, she was too much alarmed to go alone, so
      I rose and accompanied her. The rest you know; but you can never know the
      agony of mind I suffered after you had left me: first, the dreadful
      interval of suspense before the robbers came upstairs, and then the
      fearful sounds of the conflict. I felt sure they would kill you, and I
      thought how wickedly selfish I had been to allow you to stay there and
      meet them, when, but for me, you might have escaped. I felt as if I had
      condemned you to death, and that I could never&mdash;never be happy again.
      Oh! it was too horrible!&rdquo; and carried away by the recollections she had
      called up, Annie sank into a chair and covered her eyes with her hands, as
      if to shut out some painful object.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lewis, what had been his feelings, as, hurried on by the interest of
      her subject, Annie had thus unconsciously afforded him a glimpse into the
      inmost recesses of her heart? When she mentioned that her impulse on the
      first alarm of danger had been to rely on his protection, his dark eyes
      beamed with an inexpressible tenderness; but as she proceeded, and her
      artless confession proved that in the moment of peril her fears were not
      for herself but for him, his emotions became uncontrollable, and the
      volcano of passion, whose secret fires had already begun to prey upon his
      very life-springs, threatened to burst forth and bear down all before it.
      Already he had half risen from his seat; in another moment his arm would
      have encircled her, and the words that told of his deep, his overpowering
      love&mdash;the words that, once said, could never have been recalled,
      would have been poured forth, when, by one of those dispensations of
      Providence which men call Chance, his eye fell upon two persons who were
      pacing, arm-in-arm, along a terrace walk on the farthest side of the lawn&mdash;they
      were General Grant and Lord Bellefield. The revulsion of feeling was
      instantaneous; duty, honour, pride, all came to the rescue, and the fight
      was won, but the cost remained yet to reckon. Lewis, once excited, was not
      a person to take half-measures; with the speed of thought, the resolution
      rushed upon him that while their mutual relations remained unchanged, he
      and Annie must never meet again. The purpose was no sooner formed than it
      was acted upon. Turning to his companion, who, engrossed by her own
      feelings, had remained wholly unconscious of the struggle that had been
      proceeding in Lewis&rsquo;s breast, he said in a calm, mournful voice, &ldquo;Although
      I have not exactly received evil tidings, yet circumstances have occurred
      which require my presence elsewhere, and I am now about to ask your
      father&rsquo;s permission to leave Broadhurst; this will, therefore, probably be
      the last time I shall see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you return,&rdquo; interrupted Annie eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bitter smile flitted across Lewis&rsquo;s mouth as he replied, &ldquo;Yes, until I
      return! I will therefore bid you good-bye at once.&rdquo; He paused, and his eye
      fell upon a rose-bud she was unconsciously playing with. &ldquo;I have a fancy
      for that flower,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;will you give it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, let me find you a better one,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;this is blighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which reason I prefer it to any other; you know I have odd fancies
      sometimes.&rdquo; He took the bud from her, fixed it in his buttonhole, then
      resumed, &ldquo;I must now seek the General&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie regarded him with a pleading glance, as though she would fain learn
      more; but reading in the stern resolution of his countenance the inutility
      of further questioning, held out her hand in silence; he took it, clasped
      it in his own, then, yielding to an irresistible impulse, pressed it
      hurriedly to his lips, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant was naturally by no means of a suspicious disposition; the
      position in which he was placed giving him irresponsible authority over
      nearly every person with whom he came in contact, had rendered him pompous
      and arbitrary; but although not a man of enlarged mind, or possessing much
      delicacy of perception, he was actuated by a strong principle of justice.
      This attribute imparted a degree of frankness and generosity to his
      character, which, despite occasional displays of obstinacy or prejudice,
      caused him to be very generally respected, and in some instances beloved.
      To a mind of this nature there can be nothing more vexatious or annoying
      than to have its preconceived opinions of a person shaken by artful
      insinuations, which will require long and patient investigation to verify
      or disprove. In such a state of mind as we have described, however, did
      Lord Bellefield leave General Grant when, after pacing up and down the
      memorable terrace walk which had been the scene of De Grandeville&rsquo;s
      ill-judged confidence to Charley Leicester, he at length quitted him. The
      subject of their conversation had been the character of Lewis Arundel; and
      Lord Bellefield had taken advantage of the General&rsquo;s momentary irritation
      against the young tutor to suggest, rather than positively to make, the
      following accusation:&mdash;He first hinted that the General had been
      deceived by Lewis&rsquo;s fair seeming, to adopt a wrong view of his
      disposition, and that, instead of the chivalrous, high-spirited,
      honourable being he imagined him, he was in fact an artful and
      accomplished hypocrite. He then proceeded to state that he had long seen
      this, and even suspected the object of his lengthened residence at
      Broadhurst, nay, possibly of his original entrance into that family; this
      object he declared to be a systematic design to ensnare the affections of
      the General&rsquo;s daughter, probably relying on his good looks and insinuating
      manner to enable him to inveigle her into a runaway marriage. &ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; he
      observed, &ldquo;his animosity towards me; hence his unsuccessful attempts to
      blacken my character, first in regard to poor Mellerton&rsquo;s affair, and now
      concerning the poacher&rsquo;s daughter. If he could once have succeeded in
      producing a quarrel between us, he would have had a clear field to
      himself. I was unwilling to disturb you by telling you this before, sir,&rdquo;
       he continued. &ldquo;I felt perfect confidence in my cousin Annie&rsquo;s affection;
      and as to the young fellow himself, he was of course quite beneath my
      notice; but Annie, after all, is a mere girl, and naturally inexperienced
      in the ways of the world. Since the hint you threw out, advising me to
      proceed with gentleness, because she appeared to have some girlish
      scruples as to the renewal of the engagement, I have felt it was incumbent
      on me to put you on your guard without delay. The man is handsome&mdash;chance
      has given him many opportunities of interesting a romantic girl, and it
      must be confessed our dear Annie has a spice of romance about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so, sir,&rdquo; interrupted the General snappishly; &ldquo;none of the
      Grants ever were romantic. I am not romantic myself, and I do not believe
      a daughter of mine would forget her duty, her position, in fact her
      relationship to me, so far as to indulge in romance in regard to a private
      tutor. Moreover, I believe Mr. Arundel to be a highly honourable young
      man; he is the son of a soldier and a gentleman, and I cannot but consider
      that you wrong him by your suspicions; at the same time, I promise you the
      matter shall be looked into, the engagement between my daughter and
      yourself formally renewed, and the moment she is of age, it is my wish
      that the marriage should take place. It is desirable for your sake as well
      as for hers. I trust when you become a married man to see you give up
      racing, and take more interest in public business. It is, as you are
      aware, my intention to settle Broadhurst upon your second son; it will
      therefore behove you to distinguish yourself as one in whom the families
      of Leicester and Grant are united.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the General relapsed into a solemn silence, and Lord
      Bellefield, inly raging at the tone of authority which his future
      father-in-law saw fit to assume towards him, quitted him, leaving the
      poison he had instilled into his mind to work; and it did work, for
      although he was disinclined in the highest degree to admit the truth of
      his intended son-in-law&rsquo;s insinuations against Lewis, yet he could not
      banish them from his mind. A thousand little circumstances came to his
      recollection of which at the moment he had thought nothing, but which now
      appeared to favour Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s view of the case; and for the first
      time his own imprudence in throwing so constantly together two young
      people in every way calculated to attract each other occurred to him, and
      he paced the terrace walk in a frame of mind by no means customary to that
      gallant officer&mdash;viz., one of self-reprobation. While thus pondering,
      at a sudden turn in the walk the object of his thoughts appeared before
      him, looking so tall, dark, and cold, as, with his arms folded across his
      breast, he stood statue-like beneath the shadow of an old yew-tree, that
      the General started as though he had seen a ghost. If any such notion
      occurred to him, however, the illusion was soon dissipated, for Lewis,
      raising his hat, advanced towards him and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sought you, General Grant, to thank you for all the generous
      courtesy I have received at your hands, and to tell you that it is
      impossible for me longer to continue a member of your household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis spoke these words calmly and respectfully, the General&rsquo;s face
      assumed an expression of surprise and dismay most wonderful to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;resign your appointment as tutor to my ward! quit
      Sir Walter before you have completed his education, when your system has
      been so surprisingly successful, too! Oh, the thing is impossible, I
      cannot hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of sorrow passed across Lewis&rsquo;s features as the General mentioned
      Walter, but he replied with the same calm, respectful, but determined
      manner, which, to one who knew him well, would have proved that he was
      acting in accordance with some resolve that he had formed upon principle,
      and to which he would adhere inflexibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieved to be obliged to relinquish my task unfinished,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;more especially since the interest I have long felt in my poor pupil has
      rendered duties which others might consider irksome a labour of love to
      me. I trust, however, that I have been enabled so far to develop poor
      Walter&rsquo;s intellects that any person who will treat him judiciously and
      kindly (and to no other, I am sure, you would entrust him) may be able to
      complete all that remains to be done towards his education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what is your reason for this sudden determination, Mr. Arundel?&rdquo;
       inquired the General, becoming more and more perplexed as he perceived
      that it would be no easy matter to alter Lewis&rsquo;s determination. &ldquo;I presume
      some more advantageous prospect has been thrown open to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis shook his head mournfully. &ldquo;You wrong me by such a supposition,
      sir,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;my future, as far as I can foresee it, is not a bright
      one, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Lord Bellefield in any way annoyed or interfered with you?&rdquo; inquired
      the General, as a suspicion crossed his mind that his amiable future
      son-in-law might have taken some aggressive step against the young tutor;
      but Lewis again replied in the negative, adding that his reason for
      resigning his post was entirely of a personal nature, and that he had not
      come to the conclusion without due consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; returned the General, drawing himself up stiffly, as the
      suspicions instilled by Lord Bellefield suddenly flashed across his mind,
      &ldquo;these enigmas are past my comprehension. You propose to resign at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice the conduct of my ward&rsquo;s education, thereby materially
      injuring him, and causing me the greatest inconvenience and annoyance; I
      think, therefore, you owe it to me as well as to yourself candidly to
      state your reason for so doing; at all events I must be allowed to say
      such concealment is most unlike your usual frank and manly course of
      proceeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the General uttered this reproach Lewis coloured, and his compressed
      lip and knitted brow told how deeply it affected him. When the other had
      ceased speaking he answered haughtily, &ldquo;Your reproof may be deserved,
      General Grant, but it was my wish to save us both pain, which alone
      induced me to desire the concealment you reprobate; your words, however,
      oblige me to speak openly, and cost what it may, I will do so. <i>I cannot
      remain longer beneath your roof \ because I love your daughter</i>. Wait,&rdquo;
       he continued sternly, as with a start of horrified surprise the General
      seemed about to give vent to his indignation in a torrent of words, &ldquo;you
      have forced me to speak, and must now hear me out. I well know the
      feelings with which you regard my mad presumption, as you consider it; I
      know better even than you do the gulf which lies between your daughter and
      your paid dependant; but nature recognises no such distinctions&mdash;the
      same God who made her good and beautiful implanted in my breast the
      admiration for those qualities, and I could no more exist in her presence
      without loving her than I could stand in the glorious sunshine without
      feeling its genial warmth. My love was from the beginning as hopeless as I
      know it to be at this moment, when I read in your lowering brow that if
      your frown could annihilate me, you would deem the punishment only too
      mild for my offence against your pride of station; and yet I know, and you
      know it too, that casting aside the adventitious gifts of rank and
      fortune, my nature is more akin to your own than is that of the titled
      worldling you have selected as your future son-in-law. Before night sets
      in I shall have left this house for ever, and from that moment to you and
      yours I shall be as one dead. I may therefore say without fear of
      misconstruction that which I could not speak as long as I remained a
      member of your household. The tale that I told you regarding the poacher&rsquo;s
      child was <i>TRUE</i>. In the version Lord Bellefield gave of it he lied
      to you. He is a man of evil passions and of narrow mind, and I warn you,
      if you entrust your daughter&rsquo;s happiness to him, a time will come when you
      will bitterly repent it. I will next tell you why I have remained here
      thus long, and why I leave you now. My passion for your daughter has been
      the growth of months; how I have striven against it and endeavoured to
      crush it out&mdash;ay, though I crushed my heart with it, none will ever
      know; it is enough that I have failed, that where I fancied myself strong
      I have been proved weak. If I have suffered, &rsquo;tis through my own
      folly; if my future appear one fathomless hell of recollection, for myself
      have I prepared it.&rdquo; He paused, drew his hand across his throbbing brow,
      and then continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remained here for Walter&rsquo;s sake, relying on my own fortitude to conceal
      the mental torture I endured; I bore Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s sneers, and harder
      still, your daughter&rsquo;s gentle kindness, with an unmoved aspect, but at
      each successive trial the effort became greater, and my strength grew
      less, until this mornings when in her tender woman&rsquo;s mercy, your daughter,
      reading in my face traces of the anguish which was consuming me, spoke
      words of kindliness and sympathy, chance alone, or rather the watchful
      providence of God, prevented my secret from transpiring. A similar trial
      might recur at any moment&mdash;I have lost all confidence in my power of
      self-control; therefore every principle of honour and of duty bids me
      leave this place without delay; and this, so help me Heaven, is the whole
      and simple truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he concluded, General Grant, whose brow had gradually relaxed during
      Lewis&rsquo;s speech, exclaimed with a degree of warmth most unusual to him,
      &ldquo;You have behaved like a man of honour, Mr. Arundel, under what I own to
      have been a very great trial, and I admire and respect you for so
      completely justifying the favourable opinion I have formed of you; I wish&mdash;that
      is, I could wish if the thing were not impossible&mdash;but it is useless
      to talk in this way&mdash;you must, as you wisely perceive, leave
      Broadhurst immediately. I will take upon me to find some reason to account
      for your abrupt departure, but you will carry with you my esteem and
      gratitude, and in whatever career you may think fit to adopt you may rely
      upon my willingness to assist you to the uttermost. May I inquire your
      future plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have formed no plans,&rdquo; returned Lewis hurriedly. &ldquo;When I leave your
      house my only prospect is to begin life anew, with every hope that renders
      life endurable shut out from me for ever&mdash;I am grateful for your
      offers, but must decline them. Henceforward I am likely to do little
      credit to any one&rsquo;s patronage, and must strive with existence alone and
      single-handed. And now, ere I leave you, let me again thank you for the
      courtesy you have uniformly shown me&mdash;I expected justice at your
      hands, you have added kindness also: we shall probably never meet again,
      but the chances of life are strange, and should it ever be in my power to
      return your benefits, you will not find me forgetful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat as he spoke, and turned to depart. General Grant
      advanced as if he would detain him, but checking himself, he muttered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall hear from me&mdash;I will write to you at your banker&rsquo;s;&rdquo; and
      Lewis bowed and left him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L.&mdash;SHOWS HOW LEWIS CAME TO A &ldquo;DOGGED&rdquo; DETERMINATION, AND WAS
      MADE THE SHUTTLECOCK OF FATE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;W</span>alter, I am going
      to leave you,&rdquo; observed Lewis in a quiet, gentle voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter, who was seated on a low stool playing with Faust, continued his
      amusement, merely replying carelessly, &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis knew from the nature of the answer that the sound but not the sense
      of his communication had reached his poor pupil&rsquo;s understanding, and yet
      the apparent indifference of the remark pained him; it seemed as if all he
      loved were falling away from him. He had determined that it would be
      better for Walter not to be told at once that he was leaving never to
      return, but to allow the truth gradually to dawn upon him, after he had
      practically tested his ability to do without him; still he was anxious in
      some degree to prepare the poor boy&rsquo;s mind to support the severe grief
      which he feared his absence would occasion him. Accordingly he returned to
      the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me, Walter,&rdquo; he said. Having caught his eye, he continued, &ldquo;You
      did not understand me, dear boy; I am going away&mdash;going to leave you
      for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay? how long a time? a week?&rdquo; inquired Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great many weeks,&rdquo; returned Lewis gravely, &ldquo;and you must be very good
      all the time, and do everything as you know I should wish you to do it if
      I were here: do you understand me, and will you try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter nodded assent, paused, and then asked, &ldquo;What will Faust do; may he
      stay with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis did not answer. Give up Faust, the only thing that he had left to
      love him! could he make this sacrifice?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if he may stay, I shall feel sure you will come back some time
      or other; nobody can leave Faust and not come and see him again&mdash;at
      least nobody who knows him and loves him as well as you and I do,&rdquo; pleaded
      Walter, throwing his arm round the dog&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am inflicting injury enough on the poor boy as it is, reflected Lewis
      sorrowfully; I must not deny him this thing, which he has set his heart
      upon. Well, it only makes the sacrifice the more complete. &ldquo;Walter, will
      you be happy if I leave Faust with you?&rdquo; he inquired gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; was the joyful reply, &ldquo;quite happy till you come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he shall stay,&rdquo; resumed Lewis; &ldquo;remember he is your dog, I give him
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is my dog,&rdquo; repeated Walter gleefully; &ldquo;only till you come back
      again though, you know,&rdquo; he added, gazing wistfully at Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lewis! his heart was full, he could not trust himself to speak; this
      little incident had appealed to the affectionate side of his nature, and
      all but unmanned him. He approached Walter, swept back the soft, fair hair
      from his forehead, and imprinted a kiss on it, patted Faust&rsquo;s shaggy head,
      and turning away abruptly, quitted the room. Ere nightfall he had
      completed the few arrangements which his sudden departure rendered
      necessary, and taking with him only a small travelling valise which he
      slung across his shoulders, he waited till the shades of evening had set
      in, and leaving directions with his ally Robert, now invested with all the
      dignity and privileges of butler-hood, in regard to his luggage, which he
      desired might be forwarded to a certain address in London, he quitted
      Broadhurst alone and on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town of H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was situated about ten
      miles from the park gates of Broadhurst, and thither did Lewis direct his
      steps. He paced along mechanically, with a dull, heavy tread, as unlike
      his usual free elastic bounding step as possible; he kept his eyes fixed
      on the road before him, neither glancing to the right nor the left, and
      all his actions appeared like those of one moving in a dream. The night
      was dry and warm, and when Lewis had proceeded about six miles on his way
      the moon came out and bathed hill and valley in a flood of silvery light.
      Suddenly he paused, as the ruins of a picturesque old abbey, thrown out in
      bold relief by a dark background of trees, became visible at a turning of
      the road, and fixing his eyes on the time-worn structure, gazed long and
      earnestly; then a new idea seemed to strike him, and springing over a
      gate, he ascended with vigorous strides the green hillside on which the
      ruin was situated. Passing beneath crumbling arches and over the fallen
      stone-work covering old graves of a forgotten generation, he reached a
      portion of the building which seemed in somewhat better repair than the
      remainder. Having reached the upper end of the chancel, he paused, and
      leaning his back against the broken shaft of a pillar which had supported
      one of the arches, gave way to the painful recollections which the place
      excited. The last time he had visited that spot, Annie Grant had stood by
      his side, and as he taught her how the mystic piety of our forefathers had
      striven to symbolise the truths of Christianity in the cruciform
      cathedral, with its vaulted arches and heaven-aspiring pinnacles, her soft
      blue eyes had looked into his face with an expression of the respectful
      love we feel towards one whom we deem better and wiser than ourselves. And
      now how cruel was the contrast&mdash;how completely and painfully alone he
      felt. Then he longed (who has not at some crisis of the inner-life?) so
      earnestly that he almost fancied he possessed the power to separate mind
      and matter, and flying in the spirit to her he loved, to learn whether she
      thought of him and grieved for his absence. Pursuing the idea, he came to
      speculate on many things. Had they yet told her he would not return? What
      reason would the General assign for such an abrupt departure? Would she
      believe his account, or would her heart divine the true cause? And if it
      did, would she pity him?&mdash;strongest proof of love&mdash;he could bear
      the idea of her pity.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Poor Lewis! perhaps his greatest trial was this, that at the very moment
      when he gave her up for ever, a latent sense of power told him that he
      could have won her; this was indeed the &ldquo;sorrow&rsquo;s crown of sorrow&rdquo;&mdash;the
      bitterness of more than self-renunciation, for Annie, too, might be
      rendered unhappy by his act. Then the future, the blank, fearful future&mdash;what
      lay in store for him there? &ldquo;Fresh sorrow&mdash;no&rdquo; (and he smiled as men
      on the rack have smiled when the tormentors have outwitted themselves, and
      the numbness of approaching death has produced insensibility to pain and
      robbed them of their victim), &ldquo;he was dead alike to sorrow as to joy;&rdquo; but
      at the moment, as if to prove him weak even in the <i>vis inertio</i> of
      despair, the possibility of Annie&rsquo;s union with Lord Bellefield came before
      him like some hideous phantom, and he was forced to own that there might
      be depths of misery awaiting him greater than he had yet proved. And thus
      recalling the past and imagining the future, he afflicted himself with
      griefs real and visionary, till the moonbeams grew paler and altogether
      fled, and the stars disappeared one by one, and the red glow of the
      eastern sky proclaimed the coming day, and the sun arose glorious in his
      majesty, and his earliest rays poured through the broken roof and fell in
      a stream of golden light upon the ruined altar; then for the first time
      that night Lewis thought of Rose, and of what her advice would have been
      had she known of his unhappiness; and prostrating himself upon the
      altar-step, he prayed long and fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reflection that when our sorrow has become too heavy for us to bear
      there is One mighty to save, Himself in His earthly career a &ldquo;Man of
      sorrows and acquainted with grief,&rdquo; who will strengthen us to support
      them, must console the deepest mental anguish; and we do not believe that
      any man has ever prayed truly and earnestly without receiving comfort from
      so doing. For the very act recognises a belief in the existence and faith
      in the benevolence of a Being, all powerful alike to avert the evil we
      dread, and to bestow upon us the good we desire. And Lewis, when he arose
      from his knees, did so refreshed in spirit, and better fitted to do or to
      suffer, as he might be required by the changes and chances of that portion
      of The Railroad of Life over which he had yet to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the town of H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; as the inhabitants,
      aroused from their slumbers, were drowsily opening the shop-windows, and
      making his way to a small, unobtrusive inn, breakfasted. Having
      ascertained at what hour the last coach passed through for London, he left
      his valise under the care of the waiter, and passing along several dirty,
      narrow streets, at length reached a court, in one of the poorest and most
      wretched quarters of the town. Here, after some trouble and a disagreeable
      amount of threatening glances from sundry suspicious-looking characters,
      he succeeded in discovering the abode of a certain Jerry Sullivan. This
      worthy, having satisfied himself that Lewis was not a member of the
      detective police, graciously accorded him an interview, wherein Lewis
      explained to him that, in consequence of a communication made to him by
      Hardy on his death-bed, he was anxious to investigate the contents of a
      packet left in possession of his (Sullivan&rsquo;s) maternal ancestor. This
      fact, Mr. Sullivan, whose brogue was considerably stronger than his regard
      for truth, immediately saw fit to deny, and was proceeding to lament the
      death of his mother, which he averred had taken place that day fortnight,
      when he was interrupted by the inopportune entrance of the lady in
      question, who appeared by no means dead, but in a very lively state of
      virtuous indignation. She immediately silenced her mendacious offspring,
      and beckoning Lewis into a kind of den which she inhabited, shut the door,
      and then questioned and cross-questioned him as to his connection with
      Hardy. Having satisfied herself, by perusing Hardy&rsquo;s letter, that Lewis
      was no impostor, she unlocked an old trunk, whence she produced a bundle
      of papers and a sheet of parchment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the will he spoke of, poor fellow, and them&rsquo;s
      the letters&mdash;and I only hope as you&rsquo;ll be able to find the
      unfort&rsquo;nate childring, and that they will come into the money all right&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      nigh £100 year, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea whether Hardy had at all traced his daughter since she
      left him?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he heard nothink of her, poor chap; he was a&rsquo;most brokenhearted about
      her, and that&rsquo;s what drove him to the courses he took to. He worn&rsquo;t a
      reg&rsquo;lar prig, bless yer; he did a little in the poarching line wiles, but
      only for the sake o&rsquo; the sport, same as you gents&mdash;he wor above them
      things altogether. But I knows more than he did about the gal: there were
      a young &rsquo;ooman here a week ago as had seen her in London, dressed
      out and riding about in a coach like a lady; but that wor soon arter she
      fust went off with the young swell, and wor a kind of new toy like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did not the girl know anything of her since?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she know&rsquo;d this much, that when the young lord went abroad with his
      sister he made his valet stop behind and foller him in a few days with
      Jane Hardy, arter which she in course lost sight of her; but she thinks
      he&rsquo;s left her over in them furring parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them furring parts&mdash;that must mean Italy,&rdquo; thought Lewis; and
      finding the old woman had told him all she knew on the subject, he thanked
      her for her information, secured the papers about his person, and was
      preparing to depart, when his companion stopped him, and summoning Jerry,
      whose main, if not only, virtue appeared to consist in filial obedience,
      caused him to escort the &ldquo;young gent&rdquo; beyond the purlieus of the miserable
      alley in which their abode was situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit had taken longer than Lewis had expected; and on his return to
      the inn he found the coach would pass through in about half-an-hour.
      Snatching a hasty meal, he placed the papers in his valise, and in a few
      minutes was on his road to London. The coach stopped at an inn in Holborn,
      and here Lewis, who, in his present state of mind, was anxious to avoid a
      meeting with any of his friends, Frere himself not excepted, determined
      for the next few days to take up his abode. Accordingly, he engaged a
      sitting-room and bedroom, which, for the sake of privacy and cheapness,
      were situated at the back of the house, at an altitude little inferior to
      that of the neighbouring chimney-pots. Having established himself in this
      uninviting residence, he sat down to try and arrange some plan for the
      future. He felt that he ought to write to Rose and his mother and acquaint
      them with his altered destiny; but to do so involved an explanation which
      he shrank from attempting. He tried to read, but the only book at hand was
      a volume of Schiller, and with a sickening feeling of despair he threw it
      from him. At length he bethought him of Hardy&rsquo;s papers, and untying the
      string that bound them, he spread them on the table before him. The will,
      which he first examined, appeared formally drawn up, signed, and attested.
      The testator left property worth, as far as Lewis could make out, about
      £100 a year to Jane and Miles Hardy. Laying this aside, he turned over a
      mass of smaller papers, old game certificates, receipts for rent, and
      among others a note carefully preserved, endorsed in a bold free hand,
      &ldquo;The first letter I ever received from Harriet.&rdquo; It was an invitation,
      coquettishly worded, asking Hardy to join a party to the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      races, written by her who had sinned so deeply, and had long since gone to
      give account of the misery she had caused and suffered. Lewis could not
      look on this record of an affection which even the greatest wrong woman
      can do to man had been unable wholly to destroy, without the deepest
      commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laying the note carefully aside, he took up the bundle of old letters, and
      selecting one which was partially opened, glanced carelessly at its
      contents. Why does he start and change colour as his eye falls upon the
      handwriting? Why press his hand to his burning brow as the momentary doubt
      crosses his mind whether all the mental anguish he has lately suffered can
      have unsettled his brain, or whether that which he beholds is indeed
      reality? Eagerly does he devour the contents of the epistle, eagerly does
      he unfold letter after letter till not one of the packet remains
      unperused. Again, sitting late into the night, does he read and re-read
      them, then folding them carefully, paces up and down the room, chafing at
      the lazy hours that drag their weary length and oppose a barrier between
      his wishes and the coming day, when he may act and resolve doubt into
      certainty. For the whole of that night, the second during which he had
      never closed an eyelid, did he measure with restless steps the narrow
      limits of the apartment. Leaving his breakfast untasted, he hurried, at
      the earliest business hour, to the chambers of the family solicitor; for
      half the morning did they remain closeted together&mdash;together did they
      seek the office (yclept by Richard Frere a den of thieves) of Messrs.
      Jones &amp; Levi, the lawyers who, as the reader may remember, addressed a
      mysterious letter to Lewis soon after his first arrival at Broadhurst.
      Carefully did the astute man of law examine and compare papers, and sift
      evidence, and draw out the crafty rogues with whom he had to deal; and
      when he had gained all the information he required, steadily and
      cautiously did he examine the affair in all its bearings; nor was it till
      he had thoroughly made himself master of the subject that he approached
      Lewis, and shaking him heartily by the hand, exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, my dear
      sir, as far as one can judge in this early stage of the proceedings, I
      think you have a very good case; and I beg to congratulate you on the
      prospect before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And what, then, was this prospect, at the mere possibility of which
      Lewis&rsquo;s eye sparkled and his cheek glowed with the brightness of renewed
      hope? It was the prospect of inheriting an ancient and honourable name, of
      gaining a position which would render him not only equal but superior in
      rank to Annie Grant, and of possessing an income beside which Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s fortune, impoverished by the turf and the gaming-table, sank
      into comparative insignificance. One short year more for him to prove his
      right before the eyes of men, and then, if Annie were but true to her own
      heart, he would boldly enter the lists against his rival, and in love or
      hate Lord Bellefield should find that he had met his match. Well might his
      step be proud and his bearing joyous and elated, for in twelve hours the
      whole aspect of life had become changed to him: such shuttlecocks are we
      in the hands of Fate, as unthinking men term the mysterious ordinances of
      the Omnipotent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he known the contents of a letter which was even then awaiting him at
      his banker&rsquo;s, his new-found joy might have been lessened.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI.&mdash;CONTAINS MUCH SORROW, AND PREPARES THE WAY FOR MORE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The letter to which reference was made at the conclusion of the preceding
      chapter, and which Lewis received on the day following that on which he
      visited Mr. Coke, the family solicitor, proved to be from General Grant,
      and ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young Friend,&mdash;for in that light I must ever consider you,
      after the many important services you have rendered me,&mdash;I am anxious
      to lose no time in forwarding to your account, at Messrs.&mdash;, your
      salary for the year beginning May 18&mdash;; and as you have been
      compelled by honourable feeling to throw up your appointment so
      unexpectedly, and may not be fortunate enough to meet immediately with
      another suited to your wishes, you will, I feel sure, allow me, as some
      small testimony of the high esteem in which I hold you, to enclose a
      cheque for £500 instead of,£300. I shall feel hurt if you refuse to accept
      this token of my regard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred pounds for giving up his daughter! he would scarcely have
      bought me off so cheap if I had looked at the matter in a pecuniary point
      of view,&rdquo; was Lewis&rsquo;s ironical comment, as with an inward resolution
      instantly to return the £200 he continued to peruse the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be glad to hear that Walter bears your absence wonderfully well;
      your kind consideration in leaving him the dog has produced a very good
      effect, as the animal serves to amuse him. We have not as yet been able to
      disabuse him of the notion that you will return, although I have impressed
      upon my daughter, who appears to possess more influence with him than any
      other member of the family, the necessity for so doing. The mention of my
      daughter&rsquo;s name leads me for the last time to touch upon a subject which I
      can conceive may be painful even to your well-disciplined mind. During an
      interview which I held with her yesterday, she expressed her readiness to
      be guided entirely by my wishes. With her full concurrence, the engagement
      to Lord Bellefield was formally renewed, and the marriage is to take place
      as soon as she comes of age. I may add that, as far as I am able to judge
      upon so delicate a point, I do not doubt that her intended bridegroom
      possesses her entire affection. You will not think me unnecessarily
      communicative, or careless of your feelings, in mentioning these facts;
      but I conceive the knowledge of them may tend sooner to restore your mind
      to its usually healthy tone. Should you still be in England after my
      daughter&rsquo;s marriage, I shall have much pleasure in seeing you either at
      Broadhurst or in Park Crescent. Convey my remembrances to Mrs. and Miss
      Arundel,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And believe me to remain, yours sincerely and faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archibald Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis read the letter steadily to the end. With trembling lips and
      starting eyeballs did he reperuse it; he could not avert his gaze, it
      appeared to possess a species of horrible fascination for him; he felt as
      if his brain would burst, as if his reason were failing him. Annie loving
      Lord Bellefield, and allowing the engagement to be formally renewed&mdash;oh,
      it was impossible! he <i>must</i> be going mad&mdash;an evil which his
      worst fears pointed at only as a remote possibility, when time should have
      effaced his image, and the influence of those around her have conquered
      her lingering scruples, come to pass ere the rosebud she had given him had
      withered on its stem. Why was it that the trial had become too great for
      him to bear&mdash;that his selfcontrol had failed&mdash;was it only the
      intensity of his own feelings that he feared? or was it that he hoped, yet
      dreaded to learn, that he was beloved? Did the sacrifice that he had made
      consist only of his love for her, or did the belief that he was
      relinquishing the certainty of winning hers in return add a redoubled
      bitterness to his self-renunciation? were a thousand remembered words,
      looks, glances, realities, or the creations of his morbid fancy? He rose
      and paced the room, as was his wont when deeply excited. Where should he
      seek a clue to this mystery? could he believe&mdash;the thought flashed
      like lightning through his brain, like lightning, searing as it passed&mdash;could
      he believe that he had again been duped by a coquette? were all women
      false and heartless alike? could the goodness, and innocence, and purity
      which rendered beauty such as Annie&rsquo;s a link between earth and heaven be
      mere counterfeits, and not the angel-instincts they appeared? Did good
      exist at all? or was this world an initiatory hell, and the evil principle
      predominant? Were Annie untrue, truth itself might be but a great and
      specious falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this chaos of passionate distraction a few clearer, but on that
      account no less painful, ideas began to evolve themselves: his newfound
      dream of joy had vanished; rank and fortune, valued only because they
      would bring him nearer to Annie, would become a tie and a burden without
      her&mdash;he would have none of them. For his mother and sister he would
      still labour; to support them was his first duty: in works which he <i>must</i>
      perform lay his only refuge against despair, perhaps even against madness.
      There was something else: some promise he made, what was it? his brain
      swam, he could recollect nothing clearly; hastily removing his neckcloth
      he plunged his head and face into a basin of cold water&mdash;this
      precaution in all probability saved him from a brain fever. Having
      partially dried his streaming locks and resumed his walk up and down the
      apartment, he remembered his promise to Hardy. Yes, that also was a sacred
      duty; the girl must be discovered, rescued from a life of &lsquo;infamy,
      separated for ever from&mdash;&mdash;, and here he stopped abruptly as a
      new idea occurred to him&mdash;Lord Bellefield! the retribution he had
      vowed to exact from him! he was now free, in a position to demand it! For
      a moment his eyes flashed, and the fingers of his right hand involuntarily
      closed as if grasping a weapon, and then many conflicting thoughts crowded
      upon him, and the eyes sought the ground, and the fingers insensibly
      relaxed. If he provoked Lord Bellefield to meet him now, at this
      particular juncture, would not it appear as if he were actuated solely by
      jealousy of his more fortunate rival, as if his hopeless passion for Annie
      were the cause of his animosity? This idea was especially repugnant to him
      for many reasons. In the first place, he had argued himself into the
      belief that his resentment against Lord Bellefield was a just and
      reasonable feeling, and that in punishing him for the unmanly insults he
      had heaped upon him, he was only exacting a due penalty; it was by this
      subtle argument alone that he could regard the act he contemplated as at
      all a justifiable one. Again, he considered that it would be completely
      beneath him to be jealous of Lord Bellefield. If Annie were able to love
      such a character, she was unworthy <i>his</i> affection. Lastly, although
      he was himself scarcely aware of the feeling, and although a personal
      meeting with the object of his hatred, a contemptuous word or insolent
      look, would in a moment have conquered it, he felt a natural repugnance to
      take any step which might necessitate shedding a fellow-mortal&rsquo;s blood. To
      plan a duel <i>à l&rsquo;outrance</i> as a distant possibility was one thing, to
      take measures coolly and deliberately to bring about such an event
      immediately was quite another affair. So catching at the only <i>grey</i>
      spot among the blackness that surrounded him, he consoled himself with the
      reflection that, as Annie would not be of age till the expiration of
      between two and three years, he might during that period contrive to learn
      how far her heart was likely to go with her hand in the proposed alliance,
      and to regulate his conduct accordingly. Shaping his plans for the present
      in accordance with this resolve, he wrote sundry letters (one to General
      Grant respectfully declining his present) more or less coherently, and
      then going to bed in the frame of mind of one who
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Dotes yet doubts, suspects yet fondly loves,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      must have been singularly fortunate if he enjoyed a very good night&rsquo;s
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now take a retrospective glance at Broadhurst during the short
      space that had elapsed since Lewis quitted it, and learn how events, which
      caused him such bitter grief, have been brought about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Tis the night of Lewis&rsquo;s departure, and Annie Grant sits at her
      open window gazing pensively at the moon, which moon, by the way, was at
      that identical moment lighting the old abbey and shining on her lover&rsquo;s
      throbbing brow, as he stood thinking of her beside the ruined altar. Now
      Annie was by no means in a comfortable frame of mind; in the first place,
      she began more than to suspect that she was falling deeply in love, and in
      the second, &ldquo;the thing she loved&rdquo; had not exactly &ldquo;died,&rdquo; but what was
      quite as inconvenient and much more inexplicable, had suddenly &ldquo;conveyed
      itself away&rdquo; without telling her why or wherefore. Lewis and Walter had of
      late been in the habit of spending their evenings in the drawing-room,
      General Grant considering that it was desirable to accustom the latter to
      the forms and habits of society, but on that evening they had not made
      their appearance as usual; Annie had inquired of her aunt the reason of
      their absence. Miss Livingstone, looking like a very vicious old owl,
      replied &ldquo;that really <i>she</i> was the last person likely to know.
      General Grant was doubtless well informed on the subject, but he was
      always strangely, and as she thought, most unnecessarily reserved; she
      believed Mr. Arundel had been driven to resign his situation, and she was
      not at all surprised; she did not know who that could avoid it would
      reside in a family ordered about like a regiment of dragoons; she dared
      say Lord Bellefield had some broken-down blackleg ready to recommend as
      tutor to teach Walter gambling and horse-racing. Would Annie oblige her by
      looking under the sofa? she thought she saw the shadow of a man&rsquo;s foot
      against the chimney-piece; she expected they should all be murdered in
      their beds of a night, now the only person able to defend them was driven
      away. Would Annie oblige her by ringing the bell? she wished to ascertain
      whether Robert had remembered to load the percussion cap of his
      blunderbuss.&rdquo; Foiled in this quarter, Annie waited till Lord Bellefield
      was so obliging as to stroll out in pursuit of a cigar, &ldquo;smoking under
      difficulties&rdquo; being one of his most severe trials during a visit at
      Broadhurst. When he was gone she attacked her father with a direct inquiry
      as to what had become of Walter and Mr. Arundel?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter was in his own study, Mr. Arundel was absent,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absent,&rdquo; returned Annie; &ldquo;why, where is he gone, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not inquire Mr. Arundel&rsquo;s intended route, my dear; his age and
      character render him fully competent to regulate his own movements,&rdquo; was
      the stiff response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie&rsquo;s lip curled: &ldquo;Able to regulate his own movements!&rdquo; she thought him
      fit to rule a universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is he coming back, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;ahem! not at present, my dear; that is, in fact, you may consider
      his absence as permanent. The reasons for his departure which he imparted
      to me lead me to this conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I told you so&mdash;I said he had been sent away,&rdquo; observed
      Minerva snappishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you have been misinformed,&rdquo; interposed the General with much
      irritation; &ldquo;Mr. Arundel has not been sent away, he resigned his position
      as tutor to my ward of his own free will, for reasons which I considered
      good and sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what were these wonderful reasons, if one might make so bold as to
      ask without having one&rsquo;s nose snapped off one&rsquo;s face?&rdquo; inquired Minerva,
      curiosity and crossness combined overcoming her habitual fear of her
      august nephew-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;really I am not accustomed to be cross-questioned in this way. A&mdash;you,
      madam, strangely forget our relative pos&mdash;&mdash;; however, I may as
      well mention once for all that I have Mr. Arundel&rsquo;s authority for stating
      that his reasons for quitting Broadhurst are purely of a personal nature.
      And now I beg this subject may not be alluded to again; I am the last
      person who should be accused of driving him out of the family;&rdquo; and having
      by this time worked himself up into a very considerable passion, in which
      frame of mind he was, like most other of his fellow-mortals, particularly
      unreasonable and incautious, he glanced furiously at poor innocent Annie
      and strode out of the room like an offended autocrat, as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this agreeable little scene formed the subject of Annie&rsquo;s reverie, as,
      with her golden hair hanging like a veil around her, she watched the
      moonbeams sleeping on the velvet turf. Why had Lewis left them so
      suddenly?&mdash;why, if her father knew the reason, did he refuse to
      reveal it; and still more strange, why should Lewis so scrupulously have
      concealed it from her? Then again, her father had appeared angry with her&mdash;could
      he suppose <i>she</i> had had anything to do with the young tutor&rsquo;s
      departure? And then an idea struck her which even there, alone, beneath
      the silent night, caused her face and neck to become suffused by a burning
      blush&mdash;could it be possible that she had betrayed herself, that Lewis
      had discovered her affection for him? And then she blushed yet more deeply
      at the plain words in which she had for the first time expressed, even to
      herself, her heart&rsquo;s secret yearnings. The idea was painful in the highest
      degree to a mind of such child-like purity as Annie&rsquo;s, and yet the more
      she thought of it the more probable did it appear; it would account for
      everything that perplexed her. If she really had been so madly imprudent,
      so utterly deficient in maidenly reserve, as to allow Lewis to perceive
      the depth of her regard for him, his honourable feeling would instantly
      oblige him to leave the family, and no doubt her father&rsquo;s
      cross-questioning had in some degree elicited from him the truth. Oh! what
      deep humiliation&mdash;regard it in whatever light she would, what bitter,
      endless misery! Lewis&rsquo;s calm manner, his gentle, unimpassioned kindness,
      his late avoidance of her society, since&mdash;distracting thought&mdash;since
      he had begun to perceive her regard, his stern resolve, so soon acted
      upon, to quit the family, all proved that her affection was not returned.
      Cruel degradation, to love a man who was indifferent to her, and to have
      allowed him to perceive it. Annie possessed a spice of her father&rsquo;s
      haughty disposition, though in general the many essentially feminine
      points of her character prevented it from appearing; but this was an
      occasion which called forth every particle of pride in her nature. What
      could she do to remove the stain (for such in her morbid self-reproach did
      she consider it) from her? Nothing! Would to heaven she could lie down and
      die! Her father, too, evidently suspected the truth; Lord Bellefield would
      probably be the next person to become acquainted with the disgraceful
      history&mdash;and with the recollection of her cousin&rsquo;s name a new idea
      flashed across her. Yes, there was a way of escape&mdash;a method of
      silencing every busy tongue! But at what a sacrifice! Could she bring
      herself to consent to marry Lord Bellefield her object would be at once
      attained. No, she felt it was impossible. But then, on the other hand,
      could she bear to labour under the suspicion of loving, without return
      (there was the bitter sting!), a man beneath her in station?&mdash;(she
      could remember this difference now, when it would only add to her
      self-torment). Well, fortunately, she was not called on to decide the
      question at once; she would think more upon the matter: at all events,
      there was the possibility to fall back upon as a last resource. Then her
      thoughts reverted to Lewis, the brave, the true, the noble-hearted! She
      should never see him again; he would achieve greatness&mdash;(she felt as
      sure of <i>that</i> as if she had held in her hand the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo;
       announcing his acceptance of the Premiership)&mdash;and some other would
      share it with him, while she should be the wife&mdash;&mdash;the
      alternative was too hateful to contemplate, so she substituted, in her
      grave. Yes, she should never see him again! And she recalled his image, as
      on that summer day he had approached the window to summon her to the
      German lesson, when, as she read of Max Piccolomini, she had realised his
      appearance in the dark, proud beauty of him who sat beside her. She
      remembered his joyous, animated look as he bounded across the lawn, his
      glowing cheek, his bright, sparkling eye, the waving masses of his raven
      hair, and his eager, happy smile as his glance met hers! Two ideas
      engrossed her: he did not love her&mdash;she should never see him again;
      and forgetting her pride, her woman&rsquo;s dignity, even her self-upbraiding,
      in the intensity of her sorrow, the poor child flung herself on her bed in
      an agony of tears, and poured forth the bitter desolation of a lonely,
      breaking heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning she pleaded a headache (a heart-ache would have been
      nearer the truth) as an excuse for breakfasting in her room, and did not
      make her appearance till it was nearly luncheon time. During that meal the
      General was unusually dictatorial, not to say fractious, and more than
      once spoke so harshly to Annie that she had some difficulty in repressing
      her tears. The meal was above half concluded ere Lord Bellefield, who
      excused himself by saying he had had some important letters to write, made
      his appearance. When at last he joined them, he did so apparently in the
      most amiable frame of mind; he received a reprimand from the General for
      his want of punctuality with a good-humoured smile, and introduced a
      carefully veiled compliment into his apology, which greatly tended to
      soften that gallant veteran&rsquo;s ill-temper; he interposed with skilful
      kindness to avert sundry crabbed attacks, aimed by Miss Livingstone at
      poor Annie, and introduced some interesting topic which drew out the
      elders, and gave a new and agreeable turn to the conversation; he
      sympathised with Annie&rsquo;s headache, for which he invented an equally
      opportune, plausible, and false excuse, and, in short, he laid himself out
      to fascinate, and succeeded <i>à merveille</i>. Annie felt really grateful
      to him, for he had come to her rescue at a moment in which kindness and
      sympathy were peculiarly acceptable to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When luncheon was concluded the General requested his daughter&rsquo;s presence
      in the library. Poor Annie rose to obey him. A strange, wild idea seized
      her, that he might be going to refer to Lewis&rsquo;s departure, perhaps to
      upbraid her for her share in causing it; and she trembled so violently
      that her knees almost refused to support her: in a moment Lord Bellefield
      was at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my arm,&rdquo; he said kindly; &ldquo;the effects of your headache have scarcely
      passed away even yet.&rdquo; Annie accepted his arm in grateful silence, and in
      her guileless gentleness of heart accused herself of never before having
      done proper justice to her cousin&rsquo;s kindly nature. As they approached the
      library he detained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Annie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would be affectation on my part to pretend
      ignorance of the subject on which your father is about to converse with
      you. The General appears for some cause, which I am unable to divine,
      especially irritable this morning: do not needlessly oppose him; and
      should he chance to urge my cause urgently, remember, dear one, how
      entirely my future happiness is involved in your decision.&rdquo; As he ceased
      speaking he opened the library door without giving her an opportunity to
      reply, then, leading her in, pressed her hand, cast towards her an
      appealing glance, and turning, quitted the room. Lord Bellefield was a
      good tactician: for the first time the idea crossed Annie&rsquo;s mind, &ldquo;He
      loves me then,&rdquo; and contrasting his devotion with Lewis&rsquo;s supposed
      indifference, she pitied him. Could she have seen his change of
      countenance as the door closed upon him she would scarcely have done so;
      his look was that of some fiend who had compassed the destruction of a
      human soul, the personification of triumphant malevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General began his harangue: he informed Annie that she was no longer a
      child, and so far he was right; but he did not add, as he might have done,
      had he been as well acquainted with the workings of her mind as we happen
      to be, that the last twenty-four hours had performed the work of years to
      effect the change from the thoughtless child to the thinking, feeling
      woman, for the first time cognisant of those fearful realities, <i>life</i>
      and <i>love!</i> But if the worthy General said nothing of love, he soon
      discoursed at great length of (we were about thoughtlessly to add) its
      usual <i>termination</i>, marriage; which institution he looked upon
      solely in a military point of view&mdash;viz., as a solemn alliance
      between two powers for their mutual benefit. Having given his oratorical
      powers a good breathing canter around (as he attempted to depict them) the
      flowery meads of matrimony, he gradually narrowed his circle till he was
      ambling about his daughter&rsquo;s proposed union with Lord Bellefield, and
      having by this time pretty well exhausted his eloquence, he dashed at once
      <i>in médias res</i> by inquiring whether she knew any just cause or
      impediment wherefore the engagement, broken off by him on the ground of
      her cousin&rsquo;s falsely supposed misconduct, should not there and then be
      renewed, with a view, at the fitting time, i.e., as soon as she should
      attain the age of twenty-one, to their becoming man and wife. To this
      Annie replied with down-cast looks and many blushes, that if her father
      had no objection, she had made up her mind to live and die an old maid&mdash;she
      was going to add, like Aunt Martha, but, on second thoughts, doubting
      whether the association of ideas was likely to aid her cause, she
      repressed the simile. To this the General merely said &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; and took
      snuff contemptuously: so Annie tried another tack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;she were to marry, it must be a great many years
      hence; she was such a careless, silly little thing, not at all fit to
      manage a family. Did not papa remember when she went with him and Charles
      Leicester on their grouse-shooting expedition, and their cottage was
      fifteen miles from everywhere, how she forgot to take any tea or sugar,
      and they were obliged to drink whisky-and-water for breakfast for nearly a
      week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to this papa turned a deaf ear, and showed such unequivocal signs of
      being about to get into a rage, that Annie in despair fell back upon her
      last argument, which was that, although her cousin Bellefield was very
      kind to her, and she had always looked upon him and Charles Leicester as
      her brothers, yet she did not like him well enough to wish to marry him,&mdash;&ldquo;she
      was sure it was wicked to marry any one unless you loved him better&mdash;than
      anybody else,&rdquo; she was going to say, but she changed it to, &ldquo;than she
      loved Adolphus.&rdquo; Thereupon the General&rsquo;s anger, scarcely hitherto
      controlled, burst forth, and he informed her, with great volubility, that
      she had spoken the truth when she had called herself silly; for that her
      whole argument was so childish and absurd that he was perfectly ashamed of
      it and of her; and that if she chose to talk and act so childishly, she
      must expect to be treated as a child, and submit to the decision of those
      who were older and wiser than herself&mdash;that he would give her five
      minutes to reconsider the matter; and if she then refused to consent to a
      renewal of the engagement, he should begin to fear that she must have had
      some unworthy reason for such continued obstinacy. And as he uttered the
      last cruel words he fixed his little sharp eyes upon her as if he were
      trying to look her through and through. For a moment his reproach roused
      somewhat of his own spirit in his daughter; and drawing herself up
      proudly, the girl confronted him with flashing eyes and heaving bosom, and
      then, poor child! the consciousness of her secret attachment rushed upon
      her, and with streaming eyes she threw herself at his feet, exclaiming, &ldquo;I
      am very foolish&mdash;very wicked. Dearest papa, forgive me, and I will do
      whatever you wish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus it came about that the engagement with Lord Bellefield was so
      speedily renewed.

     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ichard Frere sat
      at his breakfast-table; before him stood an egg untasted, which, having
      once been hot, was so no longer, whilst a cup of coffee, that had
      undergone the same refrigerating process, threw out its fragrance
      unregarded. In his hand was an opened letter: we will take the liberty of
      peeping over his shoulder and making our readers acquainted with its
      contents. They ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Frere,&mdash;I have quitted Broadhurst for ever, and broken off all
      connection between General Grant and myself. <i>Why</i> I have done this I
      cannot at present tell you; years hence, when time shall have seared
      wounds which now bleed at the slightest touch of memory, you shall know
      all. I have suffered, and must suffer, much; but suffering appears
      identical with existence&mdash;at least, in this present phase of being. I
      am ill in mind and body; the restless spirit within is at length beginning
      to tell upon even my iron constitution. The mind must have rest if I would
      continue sane, the body must be braced by exertion if I wish not to
      degenerate into a mere nervous hypochondriac. Accordingly, when you
      receive this letter I shall have quitted England. My project&mdash;if such
      vague ideas as mine deserve the title&mdash;embraces a walking tour
      through Europe, which may possibly be extended to Syria and Persia, should
      my object not be previously attained. At my banker&rsquo;s lies the sum of £500,
      the wages (minus the little my travelling expenses will require) of my two
      years&rsquo; slavery; before that is exhausted fresh funds will be placed at the
      disposal of my mother and sister, or I shall be dead; in either case I
      leave my family as a sacred deposit to your care. Dear old Frere, do not
      judge me harshly. I am not (if I know my own motives) acting with selfish
      rashness in this matter. My whole being, intellectual and physical, has
      received a fearful shock, and the course I propose to pursue appears to
      offer the only chance of a restoration to a healthy frame of mind. I could
      not do this did I not know that in you my mother and Rose will find a more
      efficient protector than the one they will lose for a season; I could not
      do this did I not love you so well as to have perfect faith in your
      friendship in the very highest sense of the word. Enough on this head&mdash;we
      <i>know</i> each other. In the unlikely event of pecuniary difficulty
      arising, apply to Mr. Coke, the solicitor, in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. He has my
      directions also in case of any accident befalling me, and from time to
      time he will be informed of my whereabouts, as for at least the next year
      I shall not write to any of you&mdash;it is my wish to forget that such a
      country as England exists. I enclose a note for poor Rose: may I ask you
      to deliver it in person, and break this matter to her and my mother? As
      yet they are not even aware that I have quitted Broadhurst. God bless you,
      and good-bye for&mdash;&mdash;; but we will not pry into the future&mdash;&lsquo;sufficient
      for the day is the evil thereof:&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours ever, Lewis Arundel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter Frere read carefully through; having done so, he ejaculated
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; in a tone of the utmost astonishment; then pushing his hair back
      from his forehead, as if he sought to give his intellectual powers freer
      play, he steadily reperused it, but apparently with little better success,
      for when he had a second time arrived at the signature, he gazed round the
      room with an expression of the most intense perplexity, exclaiming, &ldquo;I
      never read such a letter, <i>never!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spreading the paper before him, he carefully turned up his wristbands,
      seized a silver butter-knife, which in his abstraction he conceived to be
      a pen, felt the point to see if it would write, dipped it into the milk by
      way of ink, and thus prepared, again attacked the mysterious document
      sentence by sentence, keeping up during this third reading a running fire
      of comments somewhat after the following fashion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! well! he&rsquo;s left Broadhurst for ever, etc., etc., and he can&rsquo;t tell
      me why now, but will years hence&mdash;when he has forgotten all the
      minute particulars which would make the affair intelligible, I suppose;
      sensible, very. Thrown away three hundred pounds a year, with a mother and
      sister depending upon him, and &lsquo;no future prospects,&rsquo; as they say in all
      the &lsquo;shocking destitution&rsquo; advertisements. Oh, wise young judge! Well,
      never mind. &lsquo;Seared wounds&mdash;existence identical with suffering&mdash;restless
      spirit affecting iron constitution&rsquo;&mdash;<i>cum multis allis</i>, etc.
      Now, all that clone into plain English means that he has got into a
      rampant state of mind about something, which, interfering with the gastric
      juices and all the other corporeal chemicals, has put his digestion out of
      sorts; <i>ergo</i>, in order to repair damages he has started on a
      continental walking-tour: might have done worse; the exercise will settle
      the dyspepsia in double-quick time; I&rsquo;m doctor enough to know that. Then
      he leaves five hundred pounds to support one mother and sister till
      further notice, or till I receive intelligence of his untimely decease. In
      the meantime he very obligingly commits the live stock aforesaid to my
      care, as a sacred deposit; thus, without being allowed as much as even a
      voice in the matter, I suddenly find myself <i>plus</i> a mother and
      sister&mdash;more peculiar than pleasant, eh? Well, never mind. Then he
      asserts the truism that he could not do this without faith in my
      friendship, mentioning the unnecessary fact that we know each other Next
      comes a very funny idea: if the money runs short, I&rsquo;m to apply to a <i>lawyer</i>
      of all people in the world. Now, in my innocence I should have fancied
      just the reverse, and that if we had been burdened with more cash than we
      knew what to do with, the lawyer would have been the boy to help us
      through the difficulty! Well, one lives and learns&mdash;what have we
      next? Oh! my young friend wishes to forget the existence of&mdash;England!
      nothing more&mdash;wishes to forget the existence of his own glorious
      country! The boy&rsquo;s as mad as a March hare. Then he very coolly hands over
      to me the pleasant task of breaking the news of his most uncomfortable
      conduct to his left-off mother and sister; and for the prospective
      performance of all this toil and trouble he benevolently blesses me, and
      adducing a text of Scripture, which applies much more to my case than to
      his own, concludes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should just like anybody to explain to me the meaning of that
      letter; for as to making out either what he has done, or what he is going
      to do, from that document, I&rsquo;d defy Odipus himself to accomplish it. Now,
      let me see what is the first article in my little list of commissions:
      enlightening our mother and sister, I suppose; and a very hazy style of
      illumination I expect it will be, unless sister&rsquo;s note. should happen to
      throw some brightness on the matter. &lsquo;Poor Rose!&rsquo; He may well say poor!
      Why, she dotes on him&mdash;actually dotes on him. I&rsquo;d give anything in
      the world to have her&mdash;that is, to have a sister love me as that girl
      loves him. I know she will be miserable; I&rsquo;m certain of it;&rdquo; and sticking
      the butter-knife behind his ear, a place in which he still retained the
      school-boy habit of putting his pen, Frere rose from his seat, and
      resuming his soliloquy, began to pace the room with hasty strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can have induced the boy to throw up his appointment in this insane
      fashion I can&rsquo;t conceive. If it were any one else, I should fancy he had
      misconducted himself, and that the rhapsodical letter was merely an excuse
      for avoiding a plain statement of a disgraceful truth; but there&rsquo;s
      something about Lewis Arundel which makes one certain he&rsquo;d never commit a
      small sin or conceal a large one. If he had murdered that scamp Bellefield
      in a duel, he would have mentioned it directly. Perhaps old Grant has
      insulted his dignity; <i>Arcades ambo</i>, they&rsquo;re a peppery pair; &lsquo;high
      stomached are they both, and full of ire.&rsquo; The elder gentleman has a
      double claim, literal and metaphorical, to the quotation, if I remember
      his build rightly. Poor Lewis! I expect he is in a dreadful state of mind;
      I should feel very sorry for him if I were not so angry with him for
      bothering Rose in this way. Well, I must think about starting; no science
      shop for me to-day, or to-morrow either. By the bye, I must ring for
      Jemima, and enlighten her as to my movements, and she&rsquo;ll be as
      cantankerous as a bilious crocodile, I expect. However, it must be done,
      so here goes;&rdquo; and giving the bell a very modest pull, he dropped into his
      reading-chair awaiting the arrival of his acidulated domestic with a
      singularly mild, not to say timid expression of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jemima, I rang&mdash;that is to say, the bell rang&mdash;to tell you
      I am obliged to go out of town to-day, and shall not return till tomorrow
      evening at the earliest,&rdquo; began Frere in an apologetic tone of voice, as
      his ancient duenna, puffing and blowing from the ascent of the staircase,
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the positively cross expression of her antique features
      advanced a degree, and became comparatively crosser as she replied with a
      toss of the head&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure! what next, I wonder!&rdquo; Then addressing her master in a
      tone of withering contempt, she continued: &ldquo;Do you know what it is you&rsquo;re
      a sayin&rsquo; of, Master Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe I do,&rdquo; returned Frere humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the unceremonious rejoinder. &ldquo;I believe you go
      on reading them foreign books in heathen Greek till you don&rsquo;t know what
      you&rsquo;re a saying or a doing of; here you tell me one thing one day, and
      something diametrically contradictious of it the next, till old Nick his
      blessed self wouldn&rsquo;t know how to act to please you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what have I said contradictious, as you call it?&rdquo; inquired Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you said?&rdquo; repeated Jemima in a tone of intense disgust; &ldquo;why
      you&rsquo;ve told me to get ready a dinner for six this here very day, and now
      you say you&rsquo;re a going out of town, and won&rsquo;t be back till to-morrow
      night. Do you call that behaving as a master of a house ought to do, let
      alone a sanatory Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A true bill, by all that&rsquo;s unlucky!&rdquo; muttered Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a true bill that you&rsquo;ll have to pay for as fine a couple of chickens
      as ever was trussed, which is now cast away before swine, for as to &rsquo;em
      keeping till the day after to-morrow, it&rsquo;s a model impossibilitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather have thought a physical one,&rdquo; suggested Frere <i>sotto
      voce</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s a tongue,&rdquo; continued Jemima, unheeding the interruption, &ldquo;as
      beautiful a one as ever I set my two eyes on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s as long as her own,&rdquo; observed Frere, speculatively
      pursuing the under-current of his private annotations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tongue that with care and good carving would have lasted you for
      breakfast for a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it would not have gone by any means as fast as a certain unruly
      member with which I am acquainted,&rdquo; continued the commentator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Together with a lovely turbot, which I almost had to go down on my bended
      knees to get out of the fishmonger&mdash;turbots being like pearls of
      price at this time of year, with three dozen of natives, which was
      astonished not to be able to procure, so was forced to put up with lobster
      sauce instead, and a beauty it is now, though it will be <i>non compo
      scenlis</i> by the day after to-morrow, and fit only to make people sick
      in the dusthole, where it&rsquo;s a sin to let it go, with so many poor starving
      creatures a-wanting it, which was not the case when your blessed mother
      was upon the face of the earth, in a violent satin gownd, a setting you
      moral copies &lsquo;A woeful waist makes wilful want,&rsquo; and &lsquo;My name is Norval,
      on the Grumpy Hills,&rsquo; which ought to have taught you better than to have
      asked five gents to come here, looking like fools, and yourself the sixth,
      gone out of town, leaving me to tell &rsquo;em so, with the house full of
      good things all turning bad, and nobody but me to eat &rsquo;em, which is
      a hard trial for an aged woman, that, taking you from the month, ought to
      be respected, if grey hairs is honourable, which they don&rsquo;t seem to be
      nowadays, when we have got a bad lot of wigs over our heads, with half of
      &rsquo;em nothing in &rsquo;em but crimped horsehair, I do believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the worthy woman&rsquo;s breath failing her, Frere was at length able to
      get in a word or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good Jemima,&rdquo; he began blandly, &ldquo;listen to me. When I invited my
      friends and ordered a dinner, I was of course not aware that I should be
      suddenly called upon to leave town; such being the case, however, we must
      make the best of it. I will, therefore, despatch notes to the gentlemen
      who were to have been my guests, putting them off; and in regard to the
      comestibles, such as from their animal fabric require cooking must be
      cooked, and we must endeavour to consume them in detail at&mdash;at our
      earliest convenience. Now have I slain your Hydra, my good Jemima?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your gibberish, Master Richard, nor don&rsquo;t want to. My
      poor dear mistress, which piously departed this moral life in a mahogany
      coffin and silver nails, didn&rsquo;t used to talk so, though she&rsquo;d been brought
      up at boarding-school with the best of pastors and masters to honour and
      obey; but this I know, that the blessed dinner will go to rack and ruin in
      spite of all your cooking retail combustibles, and that puts me in mind,
      what have you been doing with your breakfast? why, goodness gracious! he&rsquo;s
      never touched a bit of it, and&rdquo; (here she caught sight of the
      butter-knife), &ldquo;Oh lor, oh lor! if he ain&rsquo;t gone clean demented. What&rsquo;s
      the matter?&rdquo; she continued, as Frere, astonished at her unusual vehemence,
      sought to learn the cause of her disquietude; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, indeed?
      Look in the glass, and if you&rsquo;re fit for any place but Bedlam you&rsquo;ll soon
      see what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus apostrophised, Frere turned his eyes in the unwonted direction of the
      chimney-glass, and there descrying the butter-knife behind his ear, was
      somewhat disconcerted; and muttering that it must have got there by
      accident, of its own accord, instead of a pen, he felt that his position
      was quite untenable, and so, retreating ignominiously to the stronghold of
      his own bedroom, he busied himself in preparation for his departure,
      actually going the length of shaving himself and putting on a decent suit
      of clothes. Another half-hour saw him on the road to&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the afternoon of the same day that Rose Arundel sat at the
      window of their little drawing-room sketching the tower of an old church,
      which peeped prettily from amid a luxuriant group of giant elms. Mrs.
      Arundel had gone in a friend&rsquo;s carriage to execute a host of minor
      commissions at a neighbouring town, and Rose, having written part of her
      quota for the next month&rsquo;s magazine, was rewarding her industry by
      endeavouring to catch a peculiar effect of sunlight on the tower
      aforesaid. Having worked with brush and pencil for some minutes, she
      paused to criticise her drawing. It was a faithful copy of the landscape
      before her nicely executed, but she shook her head in dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is laboured and tame,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;half-a-dozen touches from Lewis&rsquo;s
      pencil would have given the effect twice as well. What a strange thing is
      the power of genius, the hand creating at a stroke the brilliant
      conceptions of the mind!&rdquo; and then she drew out some of her brother&rsquo;s
      sketches in Germany: bold, free, spirited, and marked by refined, severe
      taste, skilled alike to select the telling points and reject the
      commonplace details, save where such details were required to assist in
      carrying out the leading idea, they all bore indisputable evidence of a
      true artist-mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the sketches Rose grew to think of him who had traced them. She had
      not heard from Lewis for quite three weeks; his last letter had indicated
      a mind ill at ease, and Rose had written to him to entreat him to confide
      in her, if, as she feared, he was unhappy. Why did he not reply to her
      letter? Answering her question with a sigh, she turned again, pencil in
      hand, to the window, and perceived a gentleman advancing rapidly along the
      road leading to their cottage. For a moment her pulse beat quickly: could
      it be her brother? but Lewis&rsquo;s was a figure not easily to be mistaken, and
      a second glance convinced her she was wrong; and then she gave a little
      start, and a bright blush made her look so pretty that it was quite a
      shame nobody was there to see her; had there been, perhaps she would not
      have turned to the glass, and still blushing and smiling, smoothed the
      glossy bands of her rich brown hair. Why she performed this ceremony at
      this particular moment we leave our female readers to discover, and having
      done so, of their courtesy to enlighten us. Then, like a puritanical
      little hypocrite as she was, she reseated herself at her drawing-table,
      sketching away as zealously as if the results of <i>fixature</i> and <i>bandcline</i>
      had been as little known to the philosophy of the nineteenth century as is
      the secret of alchemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute the full, rich tones of a man&rsquo;s voice were heard,
      bearing down the shrill expostulations of Rachel&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about your mistress, young woman; where&rsquo;s Miss Rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upstairs, sir; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;ll do, &lsquo;but me no buts;&rsquo; let me get by; which is the door?&mdash;here
      we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he uttered the last words, Frere, tired and dusty, with a carpet
      bag and a parcel of books in one hand, and his hat and <i>the</i> umbrella
      in the other, entered the little drawing-room. Rose advanced to receive
      him with a bright smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Frere,&rdquo; she said, extending her hand.
      Frere shook it heartily, squeezing it in the process much harder than was
      agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how prett&mdash;a&mdash;I mean to say how well you are looking,&rdquo; he
      began. &ldquo;Country air suits you better than the pea-soup-coloured atmosphere
      of London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So unable did he appear to remove his eyes from her face, that, in spite
      of her best endeavours, the becoming blush again overspread her features;
      turning away as if for the purpose of arranging her drawing materials, she
      observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma is taking a drive with a friend; I&rsquo;m afraid she won&rsquo;t return just
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; began Frere; then perceiving the rudeness of the
      remark, he continued, &ldquo;what I mean is that I want to talk to you about a
      letter I&rsquo;ve received from Lewis, and I can get on better with you than
      with mamma, I expect. You and I understand each other, you see; now Mrs.
      Arundel thinks I&rsquo;m a bear or thereabouts, and fit for nothing but growling
      and biting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I think the same,&rdquo; remarked Rose, smiling at this unexpected
      proof of his penetration; &ldquo;but you spoke of a letter from Lewis; I&rsquo;m so
      glad he has written to you, for it&rsquo;s three weeks since I&rsquo;ve heard from
      him. You are looking grave,&rdquo; she added hurriedly; then becoming suddenly
      alarmed, she continued: &ldquo;Something has happened to him, and you have come
      to break it to us&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere regarded her with a good-natured smile, half laughing at, half
      pitying her; then holding up his finger, as if he were rebuking an
      impetuous child, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How thoroughly woman-like and unreasonable, jumping to a conclusion
      without any sufficient data to go upon; selecting the most dolorous
      hypothesis imaginable, and then preparing to afflict yourself at sight of
      the phantom your own fancy has conjured up; now,&rdquo; he continued, taking her
      hand and half leading, half urging her to the sofa&mdash;&ldquo;sit down, listen
      quietly to what I have to tell you&mdash;think the matter over with your
      usual good sense&mdash;and then we&rsquo;ll consult together as to the best
      course to pursue; and if anything useful and expedient can be devised,
      rely upon me to execute it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pale and trembling, but in every other respect collected, Rose obeyed. As
      soon as she was seated Frere placed himself by her side, and drawing out
      Lewis&rsquo;s letter, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother has left Broadhurst and thrown up his tutorship; his reasons
      for so doing he has not explained to me; but as he evidently wrote in a
      state of considerable mental agitation, that may account for the omission.
      Moreover, he promises to tell me all at some future time: he sends also a
      note for you, which may perhaps throw more light upon the matter. Here it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he produced the enclosure, and breaking the seal, handed it to
      Rose. It ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not fancy me unkind, dearest Rose, or insensible to the blessing
      (almost the only one now left me) of your affection, when at this
      miserable crisis of my fate I deny myself the consolation of your
      sympathy: I say, deny myself, for wretched as I am, torn as is my soul by
      the blackest unbelief in the existence of human truth and goodness, I yet
      know you to be good and true, and love you more entirely than I have ever
      done. Frere will tell you that I am even now, as you read these words,
      upon a foreign soil; the length of my self-imposed exile is as yet
      unfixed, but many months must elapse ere I shall again visit England. Had
      I come to you, I could not have withheld my confidence; your sympathy
      would have utterly unmanned me; I should have lost the little strength and
      self-reliance remaining to me, and have totally succumbed to the blow that
      has fallen upon me. Rose, love, at times I fancied, when you were staying
      in Park Crescent, that you divined my secret! The struggle was then going
      on, and I dreamed in my folly that self-conquest was attainable; thus
      madly have I accomplished the ruin of my happiness. I have quitted
      Broad-hurst by my own act&mdash;fled to preserve my honour; that and an
      aching heart are all that remain to me. I trust to you and Frere to
      communicate this matter to my mother: of course, should you from my broken
      hints divine the truth, you would never dream of imparting it to her; a
      thousand reasons forbid it. In regard to Frere, I leave you to judge; he
      is trustworthy as yourself. If he smile at my folly in loving so poor a
      thing as he holds woman to be, his kind heart will sympathise with my
      wretchedness, even if my own weakness has produced it. I have entrusted
      him to pay my mother the usual yearly allowance, and placed funds at his
      disposal to enable him to do so. While I live, she and you shall never
      know greater poverty than you endure at present. I go to regain, in
      foreign travel, the vigour of mind and body which this blow has well-nigh
      paralysed. Thank God in your prayers that he has spared my reason, and
      left me strength to make this effort: may he watch over you both! In all
      difficulties apply to Richard Frere. Good-bye, dearest; forgive me the
      sorrow I occasion you; it seems as though I were fated alike to suffer
      myself and to cause suffering to all I love.&mdash;Yours ever
      affectionately, Lewis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose perused her brother&rsquo;s letter eagerly; as she proceeded her bright
      eyes filled with tears. Frere waited until she had concluded, and then,
      without speaking, handed her the epistle he himself had received. When she
      had also finished this, he inquired, &ldquo;Well, what do you make of it&mdash;anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose turned away her head, and drying her eyes, replied with a deep sigh,
      &ldquo;Poor fellow, it is only too clear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about the very last remark now that I should have expected
      any one to utter, after having read that letter. What a thing it is to be
      clever!&rdquo; observed Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without noticing his observation, Rose placed in his hand Lewis&rsquo;s letter
      to herself. Frere read it with a gradually elongating countenance merely
      pausing to mutter, &ldquo;Much he knows about my opinion of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having finished it, he refolded it carefully, and handing it back to Rose,
      began, &ldquo;This enlightens us in some degree as to the matter; Lewis has, it
      seems, fallen in love as they call it, disastrously, with some party
      unknown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you cannot doubt to whom he refers,&rdquo; exclaimed Rose earnestly. &ldquo;It is
      this to which my fears have pointed ever since I first beheld her; thrown
      into constant communication with such a creature, one fitted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you don&rsquo;t mean to say he&rsquo;s fallen in love with Miss Livingstone?&rdquo;
       interrupted Frere, looking the very picture of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is scarcely a subject on which it is kind to jest, Mr. Frere,&rdquo;
       rejoined Rose almost sternly; &ldquo;of course I refer to that gentle, lovely,
      fascinating Annie Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do assure you I was perfectly serious,&rdquo; returned Frere hastily. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t joke about anything that makes you unhappy, if my life depended
      upon it; but I never dreamed of its being Annie Grant; why, she&rsquo;s engaged
      to her unpleasant cousin, Lord Bellefield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the engagement was broken off,&rdquo; observed Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but it&rsquo;s on again,&rdquo; resumed Frere. &ldquo;I met a man yesterday who is one
      of Bellefield&rsquo;s intimates, and he told me that his lordship was staying at
      Broadhurst&mdash;that he has made up his feud with the General, and that
      the engagement has been, formally renewed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, I see it all,&rdquo; exclaimed Rose. &ldquo;Poor Lewis has been long
      struggling against a deep attachment for that sweet Annie, whom none could
      know without loving; nourishing, perhaps half-unconsciously, a secret hope
      that she was not wholly indifferent to him&mdash;a hope which to an
      honourable mind like his must have brought more pain than pleasure. And
      now this renewal of the engagement must have proved to him how entirely he
      was mistaken; and unable to witness his rival&rsquo;s triumph, he has, as he
      tells me, fled the spot where each kind word from Annie, and every haughty
      glance from Lord Bellefield, would have been like a dagger to his heart.
      No wonder the mental conflict has nearly maddened him&mdash;my poor, poor
      Lewis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Preoccupied by her sympathy for her brother&rsquo;s sorrow, Rose did not observe
      the effect her words had produced upon Frere; nor was it till he spoke in
      a low, deep voice, which trembled with suppressed feeling, that she
      observed his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said, more as if communing with his own spirit than as though he
      were addressing her, &ldquo;Ay, it must be a hard thing to love with all the
      depth of such a passionate nature as Lewis&rsquo;s one who is indifferent to
      him; but it is a more bitter thing still to see the long years gliding by,
      and to pass from boyhood to youth, from youth to manhood, and to find
      middle age stealing quickly upon you, and never to have had any human
      being to love you&mdash;never to have found any heart on which you might
      pour out those riches of affection which every generous nature pants to
      bestow.&rdquo; He paused&mdash;then, as the recollections he had excited seemed
      to crowd upon him, continued, &ldquo;Oh, the bitter tears I have shed when,
      scarcely more than a child, I have wept to hear other boys tell of happy
      homes, and a mother&rsquo;s love, and the affection of brothers and sisters;
      then came the silent but more enduring sorrow of youth, when tears can no
      longer form a vent for the heart&rsquo;s isolation, and the restless spirit
      preys upon itself; and last, the struggle of maturer manhood, which in its
      meridian strength contends against the sorrows of its weaker morning, and
      strives to live down the fruitless longing for that affection which it
      cannot attain, and conquering all but the one abiding grief, remains to
      own itself still lonely-hearted, and sees its only hope of comfort in the
      grave. Ay, this is grief which the help of God alone can enable one to
      endure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deep feeling, the simple, manly pathos with which he spoke were more
      than Rose or any true woman could hear unmoved. Laying her hand on his to
      attract his attention, she said in a sweet, gentle voice, &ldquo;Indeed, Mr.
      Frere, you do your friends injustice. Lewis loves you as a brother; my
      dear father had the warmest affection for you, and often said that if
      Lewis did but resemble you, if he proved as high-principled, as
      kind-hearted, and as persevering, his dearest wishes would be fulfilled:
      even I myself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, glancing timidly at her
      companion; but as he remained with his hand pressed upon his brow,
      apparently buried in abstraction, she gathered courage, and continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even I feel that in you God has given me a second brother, and that I
      should be most ungrateful, most unworthy such disinterested kindness as
      you have invariably shown me, did I not feel the warmest esteem and&mdash;and&mdash;gratitude&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here, suddenly becoming aware that Frere&rsquo;s beautiful eyes were fixed
      upon her with the same peculiar expression of delight which she had once
      before observed in them, on the occasion of his telling her how he had
      convinced Rasper the irascible of the evil of duelling, poor Rose&rsquo;s
      eloquence failed her, and she became abruptly silent. Frere paused for a
      moment, and then with a forced calmness which scarcely veiled the depth of
      his emotion, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Rose, forgive me if I am about to cause you pain; but your kindness
      has afforded me a vision of such exquisite happiness that it would be a
      source of endless self-reproach to me if through any reserve on my part I
      failed to realise it. Rose, you cannot be my sister, but you can, if you
      will, hold a far dearer title&mdash;you can become my honoured wife. I
      have loved you long, although it was my sorrow at your departure from
      London which first opened my eyes to the nature of my feelings. Since then
      my sense of my own unworthiness to aspire to the joy of possessing such an
      angel has alone kept me silent. Rose, I know my own presumption in thus
      addressing you; I am aware only too painfully of my own uncouthness, my
      deficiency in all the polished conventionalities of life; but if the
      deepest, tenderest devotion of a heart which has pined through a lifetime
      for some object on which to pour forth its treasure of love can make you
      happy; if you think that in time you could in some degree return my
      affection&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush, hush!&rdquo; interrupted Rose, in a broken, faltering voice; &ldquo;I
      cannot bear to hear you speak thus! If, good and noble as you are, my love
      can indeed make you happier-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not conclude her sentence, but Frere seemed perfectly satisfied
      with the fragment as it stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the interview may best be gathered from the following remark
      of Mrs. Arundel, who, returning home about an hour after the occurrence of
      the conversation above related, declared that when she came in &ldquo;she found
      to her horror and astonishment <i>Ursa Major</i> looking as if he would
      like to hug Rose, and, stranger still, Rose appearing rather flattered by
      the attention than otherwise.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII.&mdash;DEPICTS THE MARRIED LIFE OF CHARLEY LEICESTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e must now request
      our readers to draw on the seven-leagued boots of their imaginations, and,
      thus accoutred, to stride remorselessly over the space of two years. &rsquo;Tis
      soon done; a slight mental effort, an agile hop, skip, and jump of the
      fancy, and the gulf is passed&mdash;time is annihilated. Let us raise the
      curtain and mark the changes the destroyer has wrought. The world goes
      round much the same as before; two years make little difference in the
      personal appearance of the fifty-eight-centuries-old planet&mdash;no lack
      of births, deaths, and marriages to regulate the average supply of the
      human race; if the cholera creates a deficiency one year, more poor
      curates marry, and starving Irishmen take unto themselves wives, the next,
      and those &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; babies who contrive to turn out such very plain
      adults multiply upon the face of the earth, and the thinned ranks are
      replenished. And yet two years cause strange alterations when we dive
      beneath the surface of society and become cognisant of the fortunes of
      individuals: smiles have given place to tears, and the grief of the
      mourner has turned to joy; poor men have grown rich and rich men poor, and
      the bad (with but few, very few exceptions to prove the rule) have become
      worse, and the good advanced in righteousness; and the mass of the
      half-hearted, clinging yet more closely to this earth, of which they are
      so enamoured, where their grave is awaiting them, see heaven afar off, and
      wish feebly, and for a shorter time each seventh day, that they were good
      enough to reach it. Thus the passenger train, with its cargo of hopes, and
      fears, and wishes, speeds along the <i>Railroad of Life</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a magnificent apartment in one of those Arabian-night-like edifices, a
      Venetian palazzo&mdash;which, having belonged to one of the great
      historical families of the middle ages, whose chief was, by virtue of his
      position, a petty sovereign, was now let for the season to a wealthy
      Englishman&mdash;lounged Charley Leicester, whose own surprise at the
      change of fortune which could render such a description of him appropriate
      had not even yet ceased. On a sofa opposite sat his wife, on whose knee
      was perched a very young gentleman, to whom we could scarcely sooner have
      introduced our readers, for the excellent reason that he had not made his
      appearance at the Cradle Terminus of our Railroad when last we treated of
      his amiable parents. The present phase of this extremely young aristocrat
      was, so to speak, one of ex-babyhood; he was in the very act of ceasing to
      be &ldquo;the most beautiful creature in the world,&rdquo; and as yet retained enough
      of his pristine loveliness to deserve the epithet of a really pretty
      child. He exhibited in his proper person an instance of that strange
      phenomenon which (why, we have either no idea, or we hope, for the sake of
      morality, a <i>wrong</i> one) always excites such extreme astonishment in
      the minds of all nurses, maiden aunts, and female acquaintance&mdash;he
      was decidedly like his own proper papa and mamma. For the rest, when
      placed on the carpet he preferred a quadrupedal to an erect method of
      progression&mdash;had a strange habit of making the rashest experiments in
      gastronomy by putting everything wrong and dangerous into his mouth&mdash;never
      sat still for two minutes consecutively&mdash;would, in the same breath,
      laugh heartily and bewail himself piteously, from exciting causes, which
      may be expected to remain a mystery throughout all time, and confined his
      conversation to two substantives and a colloquial hieroglyphic&mdash;viz.,
      &ldquo;Pap-pa,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mam-ma,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gib-Tarley,&rdquo; which last was believed to be an
      infantine-English compound of his Christian name and the verb &ldquo;to give,&rdquo;
       and signified an insatiable desire to render himself monarch of all he
      surveyed by a process of general self-appropriation. At the moment in
      which we shall introduce the reader to the party thus assembled, a servant
      entered bearing a packet of letters on a silver waiter, and handing them
      to Leicester, withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters from England, by Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, untying the string
      which encircled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any for me, Charley?&rdquo; inquired Laura, who in her position of wife and
      mother looked the prettiest little matron conceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two for me, and one for you, from Annie Grant, if I may judge by the
      writing,&rdquo; replied her husband, as he rose to hand it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gib-Tarley, pap-pa! gib-Tarley,&rdquo; vociferated that individual in the
      prettiest of infantine trebles, making insane plunges at the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, raising her hand above the curly pate of her acquisitive offspring,
      gained possession of the interesting missive, then, holding &ldquo;Tarley&rdquo; out
      at arm&rsquo;s length, she exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take your boy, papa; he is in a troublesome humour, and I wish to
      read my letter in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leicester meekly obeyed, muttering as he did so, &ldquo;Wide-awake young woman&mdash;knows
      a thing or two, that mamma of yours, master Tarley;&rdquo; then taking the child
      on his knee, he continued, &ldquo;Now Tarley means to be a good boy, and sit
      quite still, because papa is going to be busy with the affairs of the
      state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this exhortation appeared to be to excite, on the part of
      the young gentleman to whom it was addressed, a sudden and violent
      determination there and then to convert his father into an extempore
      high-mettled racer, which equine transformation he strove to accomplish by
      placing himself astride on the paternal knee, clutching a fragile and
      delicate watch-chain by way of bridle, kicking the sides of his fictitious
      Rosinante with immense juvenile vigour, and vociferating at the top of his
      small voice, &ldquo;Pap-pa, gee-gee! pap-pa, gee-gee!&rdquo;

      Charley cast an appealing glance at his wife; she appeared hopelessly
      immersed in her letter, so resigning himself to his fate, he murmured
      faintly, &ldquo;The thermometer stands at 750 in the shade, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; and
      started at a brisk canter. The progress of the ride, however, served to
      exhilarate both horse and jockey to such a degree, that ere long a violent
      game at romps was established, which ended in papa&rsquo;s perching his youthful
      son on his shoulder, and still influenced by the equestrian hypothesis,
      galloping round the room with him, and clearing the sofa at a flying leap
      in the course of their rapid career, to Laura&rsquo;s undisguised terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, my dear Charles, that will do; you will break the child&rsquo;s neck and
      your own also to a certainty if you do such wild things. Now ring for
      nurse to take him, I want to talk to you about this letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarley,&rdquo; however, by no means approving of this arrangement, and
      insisting strenuously upon a prolongation of his ride, his father, who it
      must be confessed rather spoiled him than otherwise, complied with his
      demand for &ldquo;Gee-gee more!&rdquo; by again dashing round the room with him, and
      continuing his headlong course till he had deposited his rider within the
      august precincts of the nursery, where the precocious Ducrow, falling
      under the baleful glance of an autocratic nurse, subsided into a state of
      infantine depression, and was heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester, having returned to the apartment in which he had left his wife,
      flung himself, in a state of apparent exhaustion, upon the sofa he had
      lately jumped over, exclaiming, &ldquo;That child will be the death of me, I&rsquo;m
      certain of it; where he can get all this dreadful energy of character from
      I can&rsquo;t conceive. It must come from the Peyton side, for I&rsquo;m certain that
      even at his early age I had a much more clearly defined idea of the <i>dolce
      far niente</i> than that unnatural little essence of quicksilver
      possesses. By Jove, if he should turn out as fast when he grows up as he
      appears now before he has begun growing at all, it will be an awful look
      out for our grey hairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Charley, you&rsquo;ve energy enough when you care to exert it; in
      fact it is all your own doing, you know you delight to excite the child.
      But now be sensible, and sit up and listen to me, for I really want to
      consult you about this letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to listening to you, my love, I&rsquo;m only too happy to do so at all times
      and seasons, and I&rsquo;ll promise to be as sensible as is compatible with my
      general mental capacity, but in regard to the sitting up, you really must
      excuse me. I have a strong idea I sprained something in jumping over this
      sofa just now, my back or my shin, I forget the precise spot, but I can
      assure you it requires rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you idle man,&rdquo; was the laughing answer, &ldquo;how incorrigible you are!&rdquo;
       and as Laura pronounced this condemnation she seated herself on a
      footstool by her husband&rsquo;s side, drew out the letter, and handing it to
      him, said, &ldquo;They have consented to my plan, and are coming here in the
      course of the next fortnight; but I do not like the tone of Annie&rsquo;s note,
      she must be much more really ill than I was at all aware of, and there
      appears throughout a spirit of depression, which is completely foreign to
      her nature&mdash;I cannot understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a despatch from the General,&rdquo; began Leicester, leisurely breaking
      the seal; &ldquo;perhaps that may tend to elucidate the mystery. What a fist the
      old fellow writes! the letters all hold up their heads as if they were a
      regiment of soldiers, and his signature bristles like a stand of bayonets.
      Oh! he &lsquo;hopes to be in Venice by Friday week, if his daughter&rsquo;s health,
      which has given him some little uneasiness lately, should permit them to
      travel with the degree of swiftness and punctuality which has appeared to
      him expedient in laying out their intended route.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m very sorry dear
      Annie is ill; what can be the matter with her, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your other letter from?&rdquo; inquired Laura, avoiding his last
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Bellefield,&rdquo; returned Leicester, opening it; &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t come with the
      Grants, but he&rsquo;ll follow them before long. He has backed the Dodona colt
      for the Derby, and has got a heavier book on the race than he likes; he
      was hit hard at the last Newmarket meeting, and if anything were to go
      wrong with the colt, and he not on the spot to hedge on the first hint,
      the consequences might be more unpleasant than people in general are aware
      of. Well! thank heaven, with all my follies, I always contrived to keep
      clear of the betting-ring. I don&rsquo;t like that note of Belle&rsquo;s; he&rsquo;ll get
      into some awful scrape if he does not take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which I shall not pity him one bit,&rdquo; rejoined Laura. &ldquo;Born to a high
      position, gifted with a princely fortune; if he chooses to disgrace the
      one, and squander the other by gambling with a set of blacklegs, he
      deserves whatever he may meet with. I hope I have not pained you, Charley
      dearest,&rdquo; she continued, observing a slight shade of annoyance on her
      husband&rsquo;s good-humoured face; &ldquo;but truth is truth; I cannot like that man;
      I wish he were not your brother, and oh! how I wish he were not to be the
      husband of our darling Annie. I say, Charley, how came it you never fell
      in love with her yourself? Do you know&mdash;don&rsquo;t be conceited now&mdash;I
      think I was very lucky to get you under the circumstances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gay laughing answer rose to the lips of Charles Leicester, and then the
      memory of the empty, heartless life he had led before his marriage, and
      the deep, true happiness he had enjoyed since, came across him, and
      drawing his wife towards him, he imprinted a kiss on her smooth forehead
      as he replied, &ldquo;If I am, indeed, worthy of your affection, darling, it is
      you alone who have rendered me so, for before I knew you I was a mere
      conceited, idle, frivolous butterfly, spoiled by the world, and with just
      sense enough (like most spoilt children) to despise my spoiler, without
      sufficient manliness of nature to free myself from its trammels by any
      unassisted efforts of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What reply Laura made to this speech, if indeed she made any, we do not
      feel ourselves called upon to chronicle; suffice it to say that she did
      not, by word, look, or deed evince the smallest symptom of having repented
      of her bargain. A pause ensued, which was broken by Leicester, who
      exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I was very nearly forgetting all about it&mdash;what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
       then drawing out a small enamelled watch, one of the relics of former days
      of dandyism, he continued, &ldquo;half-past three; there is just time. I have
      procured an order to see the pictures Cardinal d&rsquo;Ancona was telling you
      about last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the two paintings from Lord Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Giaour,&rsquo; by the young artist
      about whom no one knows anything, and who is said to be a genius? I&rsquo;m so
      glad; when shall we go?&rdquo; inquired Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a case of Hobson&rsquo;s choice,&rdquo; returned Leicester; &ldquo;for it seems
      the painter was so tormented by idle people coming to his studio that he
      has been forced to lay down a rule only to admit visitors on two days in
      the week, from three till five; but the oddest part of the business is
      that he chooses to be absent on these occasions, leaving an old attendant
      to play cicerone&mdash;in fact, there appears to be some kind of mystery
      about the man. However, to-day is <i>the</i> day, so the sooner we&rsquo;re off
      the better, more especially as I must be with the Consul by half-past
      four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be ready in less than five minutes,&rdquo; rejoined Laura, &ldquo;so let us
      prosecute this wondrous adventure by all means&mdash;a mystery is such a
      rarity in these matter-of-fact days, that even so small a one as that of a
      man who prefers avoiding one&rsquo;s notice instead of seeking to obtrude
      himself upon it, is interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will women cease to be curious?&rdquo; soliloquised Leicester, elongating
      his body in order to reach a newspaper without the trouble of rising.
      Another quarter of an hour saw them en route.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Leicester&rsquo;s able guidance they stopped at the door of a small house
      at the corner of a street turning out of the square of St. Mark&rsquo;s. On
      presenting the order an old man with grey hair came forward and ushered
      the visitors into a room lighted by a skylight, beneath which were
      arranged various pictures, some finished, others in a less forward state
      of preparation. After examining several of the smaller sketches, which
      displayed unusual talent, both Leicester and his wife paused with one
      accord before a large painting. The old cicerone approached them, &ldquo;That is
      the picture,&rdquo; he said in Italian, &ldquo;about which every one is talking; it is
      very grand, but the companion picture is finer: the Signore has refused
      600 guineas for the pair. They are taken from your Lord Byron&rsquo;s poem, the
      &lsquo;Giaour&rsquo;; here is the passage, <i>ecco lo!</i>&rdquo; As he spoke he pointed to
      the following stanzas&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;With sabre shiver&rsquo;d to the hilt,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Yet dripping with the blood he spilt;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Yet strain&rsquo;d within the sever&rsquo;d hand
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Which quivers round that faithless brand;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      His turban far behind him roll&rsquo;d,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And cleft in twain its firmest fold;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His flowing robe by falchion torn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And crimson as those clouds of morn
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      That, streak&rsquo;d with dusky red, portend
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The day shall have a stormy end;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A stain on every bush that bore
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A fragment of his palampore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      His breast with wounds unnumber&rsquo;d riv&rsquo;n,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      His back to earth, his face to heaven,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Fall&rsquo;n Hassan lies&mdash;his unclosed eye
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Yet lowering on his enemy,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      As if the hour that seal&rsquo;d his fate
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Surviving left his quenchless hate;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And o&rsquo;er him bends that foe with brow
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      As dark as his that bled below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist had indeed well represented the fearful tragedy; the principal
      light in the painting fell upon the figure, and especially the face of the
      prostrate Hassan, which convulsed by the death agony, yet glanced with an
      expression of &ldquo;quenchless hate&rdquo; upon his destroyer. The features of the
      Giaour, owing to the position in which he stood, with one foot planted on
      the breast of his fallen enemy, were not visible, but his figure was tall
      and commanding, and his attitude in the highest degree expressive of
      triumphant power. Leaning against the same easel stood the companion
      picture&mdash;it contained but a single figure, but it was one which being
      seen, it was scarcely possible to forget, such a living embodiment did it
      present of hopeless despair. The stony eye, the sunken cheek, the stern
      yet spiritless mouth&mdash;all spoke of one who had indeed &ldquo;nothing left
      to love or hate,&rdquo; all realised the painful description of &ldquo;the vacant
      bosom&rsquo;s wilderness,&rdquo; that paralysis of the soul in which
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The keenest pangs the wretched find
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Are rapture to the dreary void,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The leafless desert of the mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In this painting also the features of the Giaour were partially concealed
      by the hood of a monk&rsquo;s frock, which threw a deep shade across them, and
      the drooping, nerveless figure served in great degree to tell the tale.
      The two pictures were entitled &ldquo;Revenge, and its Fruits.&rdquo; Laura and her
      husband gazed at them long and silently; at length Leicester observed,
      with the air of a man who tries to dissipate a sentiment akin to
      superstitious fear, by listening to the sound of his own voice&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon
      my word, they are very extraordinary pictures; there&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know what
      about them&mdash;a kind of uncomfortable fascination&mdash;they&rsquo;re very
      horrible, but they&rsquo;re very clever, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! they are most wonderful,&rdquo; returned Laura in a subdued voice, as if
      she almost feared to trust herself to speak, &ldquo;particularly the second. I
      never saw anything express such utter hopelessness as that face and
      attitude; one feels that active pain even would be a relief to the
      monotony of that dull despair. What an uncommon person the artist must be!
      The execution is good, but it is the mind in the pictures that is so
      extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leicester, who during this speech had been attentively examining the face
      of the prostrate Hassan, suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;Yes! of course, now I see
      who it is. Look here, Laura, do you perceive a likeness to anybody you
      know in the face of this floored individual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus accosted, Laura, after a moment&rsquo;s scrutiny, replied, &ldquo;It is like your
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what struck me,&rdquo; returned Leicester; &ldquo;what a quaint coincidence!
      I&rsquo;ve seen some one somewhere of whom the other fellow reminds me too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The figure bears a shadowy resemblance to the Signore Luigi himself,
      Eccellenza,&rdquo; observed the old attendant; &ldquo;at least, I have always thought
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be rather an alarming, sanguinary kind of personage, at that
      rate; he has not flattered himself, I must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Signore is tall and dark, but handsome as the Belvidere Apollo&mdash;he
      is not sanguinary as you say, Signore, but of a gentle kindness which
      touches the heart. I am bound to love him, for he saved me from ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that? tell me,&rdquo; asked Laura in a tone of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Laura, I am grieved to prevent your hearing this worthy man&rsquo;s
      recital, but unfortunately it only wants five minutes of the time at which
      I promised to be with the Consul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long shall you be obliged to stay with him?&rdquo; inquired his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less than half-an-hour, perhaps twenty-five minutes would suffice,&rdquo; was
      the reply; &ldquo;shall I leave you here and come back for you before five
      o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are several pictures the Signora has not yet examined,&rdquo; suggested
      the old man. Thus urged, Laura consented to remain; an idea which she
      would not confess even to her husband, so wild and fanciful did she feel
      it to be, had taken possession of her, and her curiosity in regard to the
      mysterious artist had become redoubled.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV.&mdash;TREATS OF A METAMORPHOSIS NOT DESCRIBED BY OVID.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;Y</span>ou were going to
      tell me some anecdote,&rdquo; Laura observed as Leicester quitted the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cicerone, who was a venerable-looking old man with grey hair and a
      thoroughly Italian cast of features, placed a chair for the lady before a
      view in Venice, at which she had not yet looked, and then resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Favorisca di sedersi la prego Signora</i>. I was going to relate how
      the Signore whom I serve generously rescued me from ruin; but to do so I
      must trouble the Eccellenza with a few particulars of my own history. I
      was originally educated as a painter, but although I was a correct
      copyist, and possessed some skill in mixing colours, I had not the <i>afflatus</i>,
      the inexplicable, the divine gift of genius, which cannot be acquired.
      Look at these pictures,&rdquo; he continued, warming into enthusiasm as lie
      pointed to the paintings from the &ldquo;Giaour&rdquo;; &ldquo;in my prime I could execute
      better than that, my colouring was richer and smoother, my shades less
      hard and abrupt, though to acquire that skill had cost me fifteen years&rsquo;
      constant study; but alas! the mind was wanting. I could execute but I
      could not conceive&mdash;my pictures would never have entranced any one as
      you were entranced before those great soul-creations!&rdquo; He paused, sighed
      deeply, then resumed: &ldquo;So I grew poor, I had a wife and children to
      support, and I bent my pride to become a scene-painter at the Fenice
      Theatre. I worked there twenty long years, and then from over use my
      eyesight grew dim, and they discarded me. After that I was employed by the
      great painter of the day, Signore B&mdash;elli, to prepare canvas and mix
      colours for the young artists whom he instructed. A year and a half ago a
      pupil came to study with him&mdash;he was a stranger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what country?&rdquo; inquired Laura eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot inform the Signora. He speaks French, German, Italian, and very
      rarely English, equally well, but I do not think he is a fellow-countryman
      of mine. The other young artists who frequented B&mdash;elli&rsquo;s studio
      would often tease me for sport, but the Signore was always kind, and would
      not permit them to do so when he was present. One day a pupil, who was
      finishing the drapery of a Madonna and Child, of which picture all the
      more important parts had been painted by B&mdash;elli himself, called to
      me to bring him some particular colour which he required&mdash;in my haste
      I stumbled and overthrew a flask of oil, which fell upon the not yet dry
      painting, entirely obliterating the features of the Madonna. Irritated at
      the difficulty into which I had plunged both him and myself, the student
      sprang up and seized me by the throat; in a moment the Signore Luigi
      interfered, and compressing the youth&rsquo;s arm in his powerful grasp, forced
      him to release me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Remember, Carlo,&rsquo; he said gently, &lsquo;Antonelli is an old man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He has ruined himself and me!&rsquo; exclaimed the other, clasping his hands
      in despair; &lsquo;B&mdash;elli will discharge him without doubt, and me he will
      refuse to instruct any longer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps there is yet an alternative,&rsquo; urged the Signore Luigi; &lsquo;B&mdash;elli
      will not return till to-morrow morning; much may be done in eighteen
      hours; I will strive to restore the face.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He immediately set to work; fortunately he paints with as much quickness
      as skill. When night drew near he dismissed us; through the long hours of
      darkness he laboured incessantly, pausing neither for sleep nor
      refreshment. With the earliest ray of dawn I was again at the studio: he
      was painting still, calm, earnest, grave, as is his wont, only appearing a
      little paler than usual; but such a work of art had grown beneath his
      hand, such a marvellous creation! the Madonna herself could not have
      appeared more lovely than was that heavenly face. It was completed ere B&mdash;elli
      arrived; when he beheld it he was amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What inspired hand has traced those features?&rdquo; he demanded. The history
      was related to him. He once more examined the picture, then turning to the
      Signore, who stood near with folded arms, gazing on the other&rsquo;s excitement
      with an air of cold indifference, he exclaimed in a tone of mingled
      admiration and rage, &ldquo;Go, I can teach thee no longer; it is thou shouldst
      be the master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Signore took him at his word. He engaged these painting rooms,
      arranged with B&mdash;elli that I should accompany him, and is now the
      first painter in Italy as to talent, and when his execution is a little
      more perfected&mdash;ah! <i>se ne saprà qualche cosa</i>, we shall see how
      men will talk of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the head was very lovely, was it? what style of face was it?&rdquo;
       inquired Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell you? it was perfection, <i>vi bisognava vederla</i>,&rdquo; was
      the enthusiastic reply. &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he continued, glancing at the clock, which
      now only wanted ten minutes to five; &ldquo;I have an idea; there is yet time,
      but you must never relate that you have beheld it. Here, follow me;&rdquo; and
      drawing out a key, he unlocked a door leading into a small apartment,
      comfortably though simply furnished, and fitted up with bookshelves
      somewhat after the fashion of an English study. &ldquo;<i>Ecco!</i>&rdquo; resumed
      Antonelli, &ldquo;he has again sketched the head, but the subject is different.
      He will not allow me to place this picture in the studio, though it is
      such a gem I could sell it for a large price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he drew back a curtain, and the light fell upon a small
      picture painted with greater care, and more elaborately finished than any
      which Laura had yet seen. It represented a girl of exquisite beauty in a
      kneeling attitude, with her arms flung sportively around the neck of a
      magnificent dog, her golden tresses falling over and mingling with the
      waves of his shaggy coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Laura gazed her colour went and came quickly, and her eyes seemed to
      grow to the canvas: both girl and dog were portraits done to the life, and
      she recognised each of them immediately&mdash;her wild conjecture was then
      the truth!&mdash;her determination was instantly taken. Seating herself as
      if to examine the picture more nearly, she contrived by one or two artful
      questions to set the garrulous old man talking again, and forgetful of the
      flight of moments, drew him on to relate to her how the Signore had
      discovered that his youngest born, the son of his old age, possessed a
      talent for painting, and how the Signore was giving him lessons, and the
      talent was daily developing under such favourable circumstances, until the
      old man had begun to hope that the boy might succeed better than his
      father had done, and retrieve the shipwrecked fortunes of the Antonellis.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was yet in the midst of his recital the clock struck five, and
      almost at the same moment a quick, active footstep was heard bounding up
      the staircase, and the deep tones of a man&rsquo;s voice exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Antonelli, Antonelli, dove sei buon amico?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a horror-stricken glance at his companion, the old man was about to
      rush precipitately out of the room, when Laura, quietly laying her hand
      upon his arm, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to be alarmed about! <i>bisogna ch&rsquo;io gli parli</i>&mdash;tell
      the Signore that an old friend is waiting to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke a tall, graceful figure appeared at the door of the study,
      and stopped in amazement on perceiving how it was tenanted. In no way
      embarrassed by the situation in which she found herself, Laura rose from
      her seat with the same degree of quiet, courteous, self-possession with
      which she would have received a guest in her own drawing-room, and
      advancing towards the new-comer, said, holding out her hand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your kindness will pardon the little stratagem by which I have sought to
      verify my conjecture, that in Signore Luigi I should have the pleasure of
      recognising an old friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us, Antonelli,&rdquo; exclaimed his employer sternly; then carefully
      closing the door, he turned towards his guest, and bowing coldly,
      inquired, &ldquo;To what am I indebted for the honour of a visit from Mrs.
      Leicester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the fact that I was vain enough to fancy the pleasure I feel in
      meeting an old friend might be mutual; and that Mr. Arundel would not
      resent the liberty I have taken in disregarding the regulations of the
      famous Signore Luigi: if I am so unfortunate as to have committed a
      mistake, it is soon remedied,&rdquo; she continued quickly, finding that Lewis&mdash;(as
      we have not intended any but the most transparent mystification in regard
      to the identity of the painter and our hero, we may as well call him by
      his proper name)&mdash;remained silent; as she spoke she rose and advanced
      towards the door. Her look and words recalled Lewis&rsquo;s wandering thoughts;
      he took her hand, reconducted her to her seat, and then in a tone of deep
      feeling said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! but you do not, cannot know the train of overpowering
      memories your sudden appearance called up; indeed I am glad again to look
      upon the face of an old friend, since you accord me the privilege of so
      considering you&mdash;glad as a two years&rsquo; exile from all who ever knew or
      cared for him can make a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so long since you quitted England?&rdquo; inquired Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; was the reply. Lewis paused, and then continued: &ldquo;I left England
      under circumstances which caused me great mental suffering&mdash;suffering
      which time and a complete change of scene could alone render less bitter.
      I travelled for five months, passing through Greece and visiting
      Constantinople; at the expiration of that period I wandered hither, my
      vigour of mind and body in great measure restored. The wonders of this
      country revived my enthusiasm for art; this, and the necessity of
      following some profession, led me to the idea of adopting the career of a
      painter. For a year I worked ten hours daily in the studio of Signore B&mdash;elli,
      at the end of that period I quitted him and commenced painting on my own
      account; hitherto my success has surpassed my most sanguine expectations,
      so that I trust I have at last hit upon my true vocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so delighted to hear it!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura warmly; &ldquo;but how is it we
      have seen nothing of you before&mdash;did you not hear of our arrival? we
      have been here more than a month!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis coloured, bit his lip, and then replied, &ldquo;My recollections of
      England were so painful that I resolved, partly for that reason, partly
      that I might keep my mind free from any anxieties which could interfere
      with my devoting my faculties fully and entirely to my new profession, to
      avoid the society of the few English who were likely to come in my way;
      indeed, my only associates have been the young artists with whom I became
      acquainted in the studio of B&mdash;elli, and the family of the worthy old
      man who acts as my assistant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will make us exceptions to the rule?&rdquo; pleaded Laura; &ldquo;Charles
      will be really hurt if you refuse to come to us.&rdquo; Lewis paused, his
      impulse was to refuse, but there was a genuine kindness in Laura&rsquo;s manner
      which vouched for her sincerity; had she been a man he would have adhered
      to his resolution, but it was not easy to say no to Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive my apparent churlishness,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but may I ask whether you
      have any of&mdash;of your English friends staying with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present; Charles and I are leading a quiet, humdrum Darby and Joan
      life, which need not alarm even your hermit-like habits. You must promise
      to dine with us to-morrow at six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are most good-natured to humour what must appear to you my absurd
      caprices,&rdquo; replied Lewis, touched by her thoughtful kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will come?&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis took it in his own, and pressed it warmly as he replied, &ldquo;Nobody
      could resist such gentle pleading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door was flung open, and Charles Leicester burst in,
      looking more puzzled, excited, and angry than he had ever been known to do
      in the previous course of his existence; while Antonelli, vociferating
      eagerly in Italian and broken English, was vainly endeavouring to detain
      him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV.&mdash;IS DECIDEDLY ORIGINAL, AS IT DISPLAYS MATRIMONY IN A
      MORE FAVOURABLE LIGHT THAN COURTSHIP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Honourable
      Charles Leicester was, take him all in all, about as easy-tempered a
      fellow as ever breathed; but when old Antonelli informed him that his
      young and pretty wife was closeted with a mysterious stranger, at the same
      time positively refusing to allow him to enter the apartment in which they
      were shut up together, even he considered that it was time to exert
      himself; so seizing the old man by the arm and swinging him round with a
      degree of energy which greatly discomposed that worthy cicerone, he threw
      open the door, and staring with an angry and bewildered gaze into the
      dimly-lighted room, discovered, to his horror and disgust, Laura quietly
      sitting with her hand clasped in that of a handsome young Italian, for
      such did Lewis at first sight appear. The period which had elapsed since
      Leicester had last seen him had produced so marked a change in his
      appearance, that meeting him for the first time under circumstances so
      utterly disconnected with all former associations, he might well deem he
      was addressing a total stranger. Lewis&rsquo;s pale features had regained in a
      great degree their look of health, and exposure to a southern sun had
      converted the delicate complexion into a manly brown, while, having
      allowed his moustaches and even a short curly beard to grow, the lower
      part of his face was enveloped in a mass of glossy black hair; this, and
      the stern, thoughtful expression of his countenance, caused him to look at
      least five years older than he really was. He rose as Leicester entered
      and advanced a step towards him; then, seeing that the other did not in
      the slightest degree recognise him, he paused and exchanged a smiling
      glance with Laura as he marked Charley&rsquo;s puzzled, angry expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, entering thoroughly into the absurdity of the situation, determined
      to improve it to the uttermost; returning Lewis&rsquo;s glance with a look into
      which she contrived to throw an amount of tenderness that by no means
      soothed her husband&rsquo;s irritation, she began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Charles, let me introduce you; you will be delighted to hear that
      Signore Luigi has kindly promised to dine with us to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce he has!&rdquo; muttered Leicester to himself; &ldquo;he might have waited
      till I had asked him, I think;&rdquo; then acknowledging the introduction by a
      freezing little bow, he continued aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear Laura, we must really be going;&rdquo; then crossing to the place
      where his wife was seated, he held out his arm with the evident intention
      of linking hers with it and walking her off forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Laura clearly disapproved of such precipitation; for without showing
      the slightest disposition to move, she replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Restrain your impatience a few minutes longer, Mr. Leicester. Having
      formed so agreeable an acquaintance,&rdquo; she continued, glancing at Lewis,
      &ldquo;you really must allow me time to prosecute it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not in Charles Leicester&rsquo;s nature to be angry with any one for five
      minutes consecutively; with his wife, whom he idolised, it was utterly
      impossible; so, making up his mind that Luigi was a kind of lion, to be
      regarded in the light of an exhibition, and stared at and fed accordingly,
      and that Laura&rsquo;s sudden fancy for him was only an instance of womanly
      caprice&mdash;&ldquo;women always went mad about celebrities,&rdquo; he knew&mdash;he
      made a short, penitent, civil speech, and then flung himself lazily into a
      chair, with a look of half-bored, half-sulky resignation, which, under the
      circumstances, was perfectly irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      That his two companions found it so was evidenced by their simultaneously
      bursting into a hearty fit of laughter, increased to an alarming degree by
      the look of blank astonishment that came over Leicester&rsquo;s face at their
      incomprehensible conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Laura could recover breath she began, &ldquo;Why, Charley, you dear,
      good-natured, stupid old thing! don&rsquo;t you see who it is yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the Mysterious One approached him, saying, &ldquo;Have you
      quite forgotten the existence of Lewis Arundel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Charley gazed in half-sceptical astonishment, and then
      seizing his hand, and shaking it as if he were anxious to make up for his
      dulness by dislocating his friend&rsquo;s shoulder, he exclaimed, &ldquo;My dear
      fellow, I&rsquo;m delighted to see you&mdash;I really am quite ashamed of myself&mdash;but,
      &rsquo;pon my word, you&rsquo;ve made yourself look so particularly unlike
      yourself, and the whole thing altogether is so very strange and
      unexpected, and more like an incident in a novel than a real <i>bona-fide</i>
      transaction of every-day life, that you must hold me excused. My dear
      Laura, I began to think you were gone out of your senses, and that I
      should have to procure a keeper for you. Why, Arundel, then you&rsquo;ve turned
      out a genius after all, a second Michael Angelo, eh! I prophesied you
      would, if you remember, that day when you painted the cow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he stooped to pick up his cane and gloves, which in the
      excitement of the discovery he had allowed to drop; consequently he did
      not perceive the effect his words had produced upon Lewis. <i>Did</i> he
      remember the incident to which Leicester had alluded? Would to heaven he
      could forget that which was branded on his memory as with a red-hot iron,
      the fact that on the day in question he had for the first time beheld
      Annie Grant! He turned pale&mdash;the blood seemed to rush back upon his
      heart, and oppress him with a feeling of suffocation&mdash;he was forced
      to lean against a table for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      These signs of emotion were not lost upon Laura&rsquo;s quick eye, and rising at
      the moment to divert her husband&rsquo;s attention, she observed, &ldquo;Now I have at
      length succeeded in enlightening your understanding, Charley dear, I am
      quite at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along then,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll dine with us to-morrow without
      fail, Signore Luigi, <i>alias</i> Arundel, you polyglot mystery. &rsquo;Pon
      my word, it&rsquo;s the oddest coincidence I ever knew, exactly like a thing in
      a play, where everybody turns out to be somebody else. Come along, Laura;
      I must try and conciliate your old friend the cicerone, too, for I swung
      him round in my wrath most viciously; I hope I have not dislocated any of
      his venerable joints; I got the steam up to no end of a height, I can tell
      you, when I fancied I had lost my love. By-by, <i>al piacer di rivederla,
      Signore</i>.&rdquo; Thus running on, Charley Leicester tucked his wife under his
      arm, and having handsomely rewarded Antonelli, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of their walk home, Laura, after her husband had again and
      again expressed his astonishment at the denouement which had just taken
      place, inquired, &ldquo;You never clearly made out the reason why Mr. Arundel
      quitted Broadhurst, did you, Charley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Bellefield hinted in his way, which gives one an impression without
      one&rsquo;s exactly knowing what grounds one has for taking it up, that Arundel
      had misconducted himself in some manner; but the General&rsquo;s letter quite
      contradicted such an idea, and spoke of him in the very highest terms. I
      thought nothing of what Bellefield said, for they never liked one another,
      and <i>entre nous</i>, I consider Belle behaved shamefully to him on one
      or two occasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura paused for a minute in thought, and then inquired, &ldquo;What did the
      remark you made about sketching a cow refer to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! did I never tell you that?&rdquo; returned Charles, laughing; &ldquo;the incident
      occurred on the occasion of his first introduction to the Grant family;&rdquo;
       and then he proceeded to give her a full, true, and particular account of
      the interesting adventure, with which the reader is already acquainted. As
      he concluded, Laura observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, then, he beheld for the first time Annie Grant. Now I can guess
      why he turned pale when you referred to it: Charley, you must be very
      careful how you say anything about the Broadhurst party before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! and wherefore, oh wise little woman, endowed with an unlimited power
      of seeing into milestones?&rdquo; was the bantering reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I tell you, you must promise never to mention the idea, for it
      is only an idea, to anybody till I give you leave,&rdquo; returned Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley compressed his lips, and went through a pantomimic representation
      of sewing them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; resumed Laura; &ldquo;if I tell you, you must be
      careful, and not blunder it out in any of your absent fits; do you
      promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do more than promise,&rdquo; returned her husband energetically; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      swear by all
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The heathen gods and goddesses,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Without skirts and bodices,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      never to reveal to mortal ear the fatal secret&mdash;so let us have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, if you must know, I suspect Mr. Arundel to have had better
      taste than you, and not to have escaped with a whole heart from the
      fascinations of Annie Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew&mdash;!&rdquo; replied Leicester, giving vent to a prolonged whistle
      indicative of intense surprise; &ldquo;that is the state of the case, eh? then
      my allusion to the cow was just about the most unlucky topic I could have
      hit upon. I certainly have a genius for putting my foot in it, whenever
      circumstances afford an aperture for the insertion of that extremity. I
      should not wonder if that idea of yours, always supposing it to be
      correct, might explain his sudden departure from Broadhurst, and account
      for this strange freak of expatriating himself and starting as a
      second-hand modern Michael Angelo. I say, Laura, suppose the fancy should
      happen to be mutual, Bellefield may have had more cause for disliking
      Arundel than people were aware of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would never have accepted your brother if she knew that another loved
      her, and felt that she returned his affection; Annie is too good and
      true-hearted for that,&rdquo; returned Laura warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; replied Leicester. &ldquo;I only hope it may not be so; for
      between Arundel and Belle I should not know how to act. Belle is my
      brother, and to Arundel&rsquo;s good advice I shall always consider I am in
      great measure indebted for a certain plague of my life&mdash;(without
      whose plaguing the said life wouldn&rsquo;t be worth having, all the same);&mdash;the
      only course I can take, if our suspicions prove true, will be to preserve
      a strict neutrality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how would you wish me to act, Charley dear?&rdquo; inquired Laura, taking
      her husband&rsquo;s fingers caressingly between her own soft, white little
      hands. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t recommend Annie to marry your brother if she does
      not love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow the dictates of your own good sense and kind heart, darling, and
      you will be sure to do rightly. I have the most perfect confidence in you,
      and would not influence you one way or another, if I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears rose to Laura&rsquo;s eyes at this fresh proof of her husband&rsquo;s
      affection; and as she reflected on what he had said in regard to Lewis&rsquo;s
      share in bringing them together, she inwardly vowed that if ever it lay in
      her power to do him a similar good turn, she would not be slothful in
      advancing his interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      True to his promise, Lewis dined with them the next day; by mutual consent
      all reference to the past was avoided, and no allusion made to any of the
      Broadhurst party. As soon as Lewis found this to be the case, a certain
      proud embarrassment observable in his manner disappeared; and yielding to
      the delight of again finding himself in congenial society, he
      unconsciously displayed his brilliant conversational powers&mdash;relating,
      with playful wit, or forcible and striking illustration, the adventures
      which had befallen him, and the scenery he had beheld in his late
      pedestrian tour, till Charles and Laura, who had only been acquainted with
      him when the cloud of his dependent position at Broadhurst hung over him
      and concealed his natural character beneath a veil of proud reserve, were
      equally delighted and astonished; and when, late in the evening, he took
      his departure, they vied with each other in performing a duet to his
      praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He talks so well!&rdquo; exclaimed Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows so much!&rdquo; cried Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been everywhere,&rdquo; continued the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And done everything,&rdquo; resumed the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so clever and epigrammatic,&rdquo; urged the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his descriptions of scenery are so poetical,&rdquo; put in the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His figure is so striking,&rdquo; said the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his face so handsome,&rdquo; rejoined the mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pair of eyes he has!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such a smile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then his moustaches and whiskers are irreproachable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his hands whiter than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, he is a stunner!&rdquo; declared the baritone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I detest slang, I must confess that he is,&rdquo; chimed in the soprano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a woman I should be over head and ears in love with him,&rdquo;
       suggested Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am both the one and the other,&rdquo; responded his wife, casting an arch
      glance at her spouse, as much as to say, &ldquo;How do you like that?&rdquo; which
      rebellious speech her lord and master punished by stopping her mouth with&mdash;the
      only remedy we believe ever to have been found effectual in such a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time forth Lewis became a constant visitor at the Palazzo
      Grassini, and at last completed his triumph over Laura&rsquo;s affections by
      asking, as a favour, to be allowed to take a sketch of &ldquo;Tarley&rdquo;; &ldquo;he
      wanted a study of a child&rsquo;s head so much.&rdquo; Then the sketch was pronounced
      so successful that nothing would serve but that it must be perpetuated in
      oils, and as the possibility of making &ldquo;Tarley&rdquo; sit still long enough for
      such a purpose did not exist unless Laura sat also, Lewis consented to
      paint them together, although he had hitherto steadily refused to take a
      portrait, in spite of large sums which had been offered him to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura received a second epistle from Annie Grant postponing their visit
      for another fortnight. Her father had all along expected Miss Livingstone
      would accompany them as a matter of course; but when it came to the point
      that redoubtable spinster broke into open revolt, asserted her
      independence, nailed her colours to the mast, and determined upon death or
      victory. So resolute was she, that after a most obstinate engagement with
      sharp tongues, which followed upon two days of sulky silence, the General
      was forced to make terms and yield his own will to that of a woman; so
      Minerva remained behind to garrison Broadhurst. As, however, the General
      by no means approved of his daughter travelling without some female
      companion, the journey was very nearly being given up, when, at the last
      moment, a lady, the wife of an Austrian officer quartered at Venice, was
      discovered, who, seeking for an escort to enable her to join her husband,
      was only too happy to be allowed to accompany the Grant party. These
      delays, however, would necessarily retard their arrival for at least a
      fortnight. Days passed away; the picture (and a very pretty one it was) of
      the fair young mother and her little, rosy, merry child, advanced towards
      completion, and Lewis began to look forward with a feeling almost akin to
      regret, to the time when the sittings, and the agreeable, friendly
      conversations to which they gave rise, would be at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since he had quitted England his thoughts and feelings had undergone
      various and considerable changes; at first he had striven, in the
      excitement of active adventure, to banish recollection, and after a time
      he succeeded so far as to take a lively interest in all he saw. The
      revolutionary spirit, which has since produced such changes in modern
      Europe, was then beginning to show itself, and he witnessed the outbreak
      of a rather serious <i>émeute</i> in one of the German States, in which he
      contrived to get mixed up, and by these means he came in for a couple of
      day&rsquo;s hard fighting, and a week of intense fatigue and excitement. This,
      paradoxical as it may appear, was of the greatest psychological assistance
      to him; it roused him effectually, and took him completely out of himself.
      The excitement was kept up for some little time longer, for, owing to the
      part which his old student associations had led him to take in the affair,
      he brought upon himself the suspicions of the Prussian government, and the
      next event of his tour was in fact a flight to save himself from arrest.
      During this period he was accompanied by a young German, who, much more
      deeply implicated in the affair than Lewis had been, dreaded that his
      capture might lead to his execution; and unwilling to atone for his
      patriotism with his life, he and his companion hurried from the scene of
      their exploits, experiencing innumerable dangers, difficulties, and
      hairbreadth escapes, ere they arrived at that sanctuary for political
      refugees, the city of the Sultan. Having by these means regained his
      energy and vigour of mind, Lewis applied himself heart and soul to the
      study of his new profession, and in the interest of the pursuit kept his
      powers, mental and bodily, so fully employed as to hold memory at bay, and
      to require neither society nor sympathy. But now a change had again come
      o&rsquo;er him; he had in great measure mastered the difficulties of his art, he
      had solved the problem whether by his talent he could secure a competency
      for himself and those belonging to him; constant and indefatigable labour
      was no longer an obligation, and ere the Leicesters discovered him he had
      begun to feel, though he would scarcely acknowledge it even to himself,
      the want of those social ties from which, in his first frenzy of grief, he
      had voluntarily separated himself. In the society of the Leicesters he
      obtained exactly the amount of relaxation which he required&mdash;Laura
      appreciated and understood him, Charles, without understanding, liked him;
      while on his part, the lady&rsquo;s society interested and soothed him, and that
      of her husband afforded him amusement and companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day approached on which the Broadhurst party were expected to
      arrive, Laura became considerably perplexed as to how she might best break
      the matter to Lewis: she had once, by way of experiment, mentioned to her
      husband, in Lewis&rsquo;s presence, the fact that she had received a letter from
      Broadhurst, and the start he gave at the name, the death-like paleness
      which overspread his countenance, the quivering lip, and clenched hand,
      told of such deep mental suffering, that, frightened at the effects she
      had produced, Laura immediately changed the subject and had never again
      ventured to allude to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last sitting for the picture chanced to be fixed for the very morning
      before that on which the Grants were expected to arrive. Laura consulted
      her husband as to the affair: Charley stroked his chin, caressed his
      whiskers, gazed vacantly at himself in the chimney-glass, and then,
      putting on a look of sapient self-confidence, in regard to the reality
      whereof it was clear he entertained the strongest misgivings, he began in
      a thorough master-of-the-family tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it seems to me, my love, that the present is exactly one of those
      emergencies in which a woman&rsquo;s tact is the very thing required. I should
      advise you to feel your way with great caution, very great caution, and
      when by this means you have ascertained the best method of breaking it to
      him, I should speak at once without any further hesitation, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better undertake the business yourself, Charley dear, as
      you seem to have such a clearly defined idea how to set about it,&rdquo;
       interrupted Laura with a roguish smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; by no means, my dear,&rdquo; replied Charley, speaking with
      unwonted energy. &ldquo;A&mdash;in fact, so strongly do I feel that a <i>woman&rsquo;s</i>
      tact is the thing required, and that any interference of mine might ruin
      the whole affair, and, in short, bring about something very disagreeable,
      that I have made arrangements which will keep me from home during the
      whole morning, so as to leave you a clear field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you dreadfully transparent old impostor! a child of five years old
      could see through you,&rdquo; exclaimed Laura, laughing heartily at the detected
      look which instantly stole over her husband&rsquo;s visage. &ldquo;Now, if you don&rsquo;t
      honestly confess that you have not an idea how to get over the
      difficulty,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that you dread a scene with a true degree of
      masculine horror, and yet have not the most remote notion how to avoid
      one, I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;make arrangements which will take <i>me</i> from home all the
      morning,&rsquo; and leave you to flounder through the affair as best you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a vixen for you,&rdquo; exclaimed Charley, appealing to society at
      large. &ldquo;Poor Socrates! I always had a deep commiseration for his domestic
      annoyances when I read of them at school, but I little dreamed that I
      should live to have personal experience of the miseries of possessing a
      Xantippe;&rdquo; then throwing himself into a mock-tragic attitude, he
      ejaculated, &ldquo;Ungrateful woman! I leave you to your fate,&rdquo; and shaking his
      fist at her, pressed his hand to his forehead, and rushed distractedly out
      of the room&mdash;in less than two minutes he lounged in again, drawing on
      his gloves. &ldquo;What a bore tight gloves are!&rdquo; he murmured feebly&mdash;&ldquo;here,
      Laura!&rdquo; so saying, he seated himself by his wife&rsquo;s side, languidly holding
      out his hand, while with the most helpless air imaginable he allowed her
      to pull on the refractory gloves for him, which she did with a most
      amusing display of energy and perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Voilà</i>, Monsieur!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that herculean feat is accomplished.
      Have you aught else to command your slave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley regarded her with a look of affection as he replied, &ldquo;What a
      blessing it is to have a good, clever little wife to do all the horrid
      things for one! Good-bye, my own! When you have done victimising Arundel
      with your alarming intelligence, ask him to dine with us to-day; I want
      particularly to talk to him. He knows the people here better than I do;
      but it strikes me the politics of the place are getting into a fix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he imprinted a kiss upon her brow, admired his hand in the new,
      well-fitting glove, and sauntered out of the apartment as listlessly as
      though he were walking in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctual to his appointment, Lewis arrived, looking so handsome and
      animated that Laura felt doubly grieved at having to make a communication
      which she was persuaded would tend to renew the memory of a grief against
      which he appeared to have struggled with some degree of success. Her task
      was rendered the more difficult from the conviction that Lewis&rsquo;s
      intercourse with her husband and herself had been of great service to him,
      by insensibly overcoming his misanthropic distaste to society. This
      intercourse, she feared, the tidings she was about to impart to him would
      effectually interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is &lsquo;Tarley&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired Lewis, after exchanging salutations with &ldquo;<i>La
      Madre</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the nursery, adorning for the sacrifice of his personal freedom during
      the period you may require him to remain <i>en position</i>.&rdquo; answered
      Laura; &ldquo;shall I ring for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I fetch him myself? I promised him a ride on my back for good conduct
      at the last sitting, and he must not be disappointed,&rdquo; urged Lewis in
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed&mdash;always promising that you take great care not to tumble the
      clean frock,&rdquo; returned Laura with a gratified smile. &ldquo;Who could believe
      that man was the same creature who used to look so stern, and cold, and
      proud?&rdquo; she added mentally, as Lewis departed on his mission; &ldquo;he has as
      much tenderness of nature as any woman. If he really does love Annie, and
      she can prefer Lord Bellefield, she deserves all the unhappiness such a
      choice will inevitably bring upon her; her greatest enemy can wish her
      nothing worse. Well, &lsquo;Tarley,&rsquo; are you going to sit still and be good?&rdquo;
       she continued, as that self-willed juvenile entered, seated in triumph
      upon Lewis&rsquo;s shoulder, and grasping a lock of his horse&rsquo;s ebon mane the
      better to preserve his balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarley&rdquo; having signified in the very smallest broken English his
      intention to keep the peace to the best of his little ability, the sitting
      began in good earnest, and terminated, as far as that young gentleman was
      concerned, in less than an hour, during which period, as he only tore his
      mamma&rsquo;s gown once, made a hole in the sofa-cover, and had one violent fit
      of kicking, he may comparatively be considered (all things are
      comparative) to have kept his word. A few finishing touches still remained
      to complete Laura&rsquo;s portrait, and these Lewis hastened to add. The
      conversation (originating in &ldquo;Tarley&rsquo;s&rdquo; <i>escapades</i>) turned on
      education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The theory which I hold to be the true one is simple enough,&rdquo; remarked
      Lewis; &ldquo;the first thing to inculcate is&mdash;oblige me by turning a
      little more to the light&mdash;implicit obedience; that once acquired&mdash;rather
      more still&mdash;you may, as the mind develops, occasionally give a reason
      for your commands&mdash;you see my object is to get a clearer light on the
      left eye-brow&mdash;thank you; don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that obedience, to be of much avail, should be founded on other
      feelings than mere fear of punishment,&rdquo; returned Laura; &ldquo;for that in
      sturdy minds produces obstinacy, in weak ones deceit and falsehood, and in
      both cases necessarily loses its effect as the pupil advances towards
      maturity. It always appears to me that in our conduct towards children we
      should strive to imitate (with reverence be it spoken) God&rsquo;s dealings
      towards ourselves. We should teach them to love and trust us, and
      obedience based on affection and faith will surely never fail for time or
      for eternity. Then,&rdquo; she continued, as Lewis, bending over his work,
      failed to reply, &ldquo;I should endeavour to make their punishments appear as
      much as possible the natural consequences of their faults; for instance, I
      should allow them to experience to the uttermost the mental suffering
      caused by pride and anger, and in their cooler moments point out to them
      that it may be wise, as well as right, to suffer even injustice mildly,
      rather than bear the distress of mind a contrary line of conduct is sure
      to entail. I should impress upon them the evil of coveting by denying them
      the thing they so eagerly sought. In fact,&rdquo; she added hastily, fancying
      from her companion&rsquo;s silence that for some reason her conversation was
      distasteful to him, &ldquo;I have a great many sapient, theoretical ideas in
      regard to education, but how they may turn out when I come to put them in
      practice remains to be proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, who during the conclusion of this speech had been painting away as
      zealously as if his life depended upon his exertions, though a close
      observer might have remarked, by his downcast eye and quivering lip, the
      effect Laura&rsquo;s words produced on him, replied earnestly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to Heaven all mothers felt as truly and wisely as you do about
      education; were children taught such principles of self-government as you
      propose, there would be fewer aching hearts among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having uttered these words and sighed deeply, he spoke no more until he
      had finished Laura&rsquo;s portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I need detain you no longer; with the exception of a
      few touches to the drapery, which I can do at my own rooms, the picture is
      completed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura approached and duly admired it, declaring the likeness of &ldquo;Tarley&rdquo;
       to be perfect, but feeling quite certain Lewis had flattered her terribly,
      at which little touch of woman&rsquo;s nature the young artist smiled as he
      denied the accusation. And now the moment had arrived when Laura must
      break her intelligence to him as best she might. Her straightforward,
      simple nature disdained all subterfuge, and she began accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a topic which, from a fear, perhaps uncalled for, of giving you
      pain, Charles and I have avoided, but which I am now compelled to mention
      to you. You asked me at our first meeting whether we were alone; after
      to-day we shall be so no longer, and the guests we expect are none other
      than your former pupil Walter, General Grant, and his daughter.&rdquo; Laura had
      purposely placed herself in such a position that she could not see her
      companion&rsquo;s features as she made this communication, and the only sign of
      agitation which met her ear was the sound of his quick and laboured
      breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s pause he said in a hurried, stem tone of voice, &ldquo;I cannot
      meet them! it is impossible, I must leave this place directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that surely is unnecessary, no one here knows you but ourselves; you
      have only to resume your incognito, and in Signore Luigi, the Venetian
      painter, no one will recognise Lewis Arundel. We will keep your secret
      inviolably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I rely on the discretion of Mr. Leicester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly; if he knows you consider the matter important, he will remain
      silent as the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so then,&rdquo; returned Lewis after a pause. Having paced up and down
      the room, he threw himself on a sofa, and covering his eyes with his hand,
      remained buried in painful thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura watched him with deep interest, till at length she could restrain
      the expression of her sympathy no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i> speak that which is in my mind,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;I
      know that you are good and true-hearted, you <i>can</i> have done no wrong
      that you have cause to be ashamed of, why then do you fear to meet these
      people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis started, raised his head, and flinging back his dark hair, exclaimed
      almost fiercely, &ldquo;Did you say fear? I fear no living being! There is no
      man who can accuse me of evil-doing; my name is as spotless as your own
      pure soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why refuse to meet them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I fear my own heart,&rdquo; was the vehement reply, &ldquo;because I have
      sworn never to meet her again till I have learned to look upon her with
      the indifference her weak fickleness deserves, and that,&rdquo; he added
      bitterly, &ldquo;will not be till grey hairs bring insensibility to woman&rsquo;s love
      and such-like gilded toys, or till she has crushed out the last germs of
      my lingering madness by marrying the heartless scoundrel to whom she is
      engaged.&rdquo; He paused, and then continued more calmly, &ldquo;You ask me why I
      refuse to meet these people; hear the truth, and then judge for yourself
      whether I can meet them; nay, judge for me also if you will, for I am
      half-frenzied by the anguish I have suffered, and am as incapable to
      decide for myself in this affair as a child, such puppets are we to our
      loves and hates;&rdquo; and then in eager, hurried accent he told her of his
      love for Annie Grant, his struggle for self-conquest, his signal failure,
      his fearful hope that she returned his affection, the parting, his
      confession to the General, the strange tidings he had learned in London,
      and then the cruel paralysing blow of Annie&rsquo;s engagement, renewed the very
      day after he had left Broadhurst, believing on no slight grounds that she
      loved him and him only. All the burning sorrow, pent for two long years
      within his secret soul, he poured forth before her; and Laura listened
      with glowing cheeks and tearful eyes, and a growing resolve in her brave,
      pure heart to set aside all conventionalisms and every hollow form of
      society, and if Annie should but prove worthy of him, to labour with all
      the energy of her earnest nature to bring these young, sad, loving hearts
      together again.

      BEING &ldquo;CUT&rdquo; BY AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;N</span>ow listen to me,
      and be good, and sensible, and tractable for once in your life,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Laura, when Lewis&rsquo;s agitation had in some degree subsided. &ldquo;You appear to
      have acted with more than sufficient self-will and impetuosity all through
      this affair, and the result has not proved so satisfactory as to justify
      you in refusing a friend&rsquo;s advice and assistance. Excuse my plain
      speaking,&rdquo; she continued, with a frank smile which would have thawed the
      moroseness of the most churlish misanthrope who ever reversed the precepts
      of Christianity by hating his neighbour, &ldquo;but I must either say all I
      think or be wholly silent. Besides, it is no kindness to hide the truth
      from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have me do?&rdquo; returned Lewis sadly. &ldquo;Believe me, I reproach
      myself for my past folly more bitterly than you could do were you my worst
      enemy, instead of the gentle, zealous friend you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have you at present do anything, more especially anything
      rash,&rdquo; returned Laura, &ldquo;but simply leave the matter in my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you I will do nothing which can in the smallest degree
      compromise your honour, or even your pride,&rdquo; returned Laura, with the
      slightest possible degree of sarcasm in her tone; &ldquo;beyond this I will
      promise you nothing, and if you have not sufficient faith to trust my
      friendship thus far, you are less worthy of it than I have deemed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis glanced with mingled surprise and admiration at the animated
      features of his spirited confidante. Accustomed to Rose&rsquo;s calm, persuasive
      reasoning, and the half-earnest, half-playful, but wholly bewitching
      manners of sweet Annie Grant, Laura&rsquo;s keen wit and fearless bearing
      surprised and pleased, while at the same time they insensibly influenced
      him. &ldquo;I <i>will</i> trust you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you have the strong sense and
      bold energy of a man&rsquo;s mind united with all the gentleness and refinement
      which are woman&rsquo;s especial attributes. I will and do trust you fully. But
      alas! dear friend,&rdquo; he continued sorrowfully, &ldquo;neither you nor any one
      else can remove the cause of my unhappiness. I will not attempt to deceive
      you or myself; despite my best endeavours to forget her I cannot, and I am
      miserable. I, who deemed myself so strong, am powerless to cast this
      affection from me; and though I despise her for her weak fickleness,
      though I scorn her for allowing herself to be contracted to that man of
      whom I never can bear to think as the brother of your kind-hearted,
      liberal-minded husband, I yet love her with the reasonless passion of an
      idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take too gloomy a view of the affair. She may not be so much to blame
      as you imagine; she may yet prove worthy of your affection,&rdquo; urged Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to Heaven it could be so!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis vehemently. &ldquo;You bid me
      consider the matter calmly and sensibly,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause; &ldquo;by
      doing so I perceive the hopes with which you would fain inspire me to be
      unreasonable and delusive. Facts speak for themselves, and as they remain
      unalterable, so must my grief. Either she does not return my affection,
      and is attached to her intended bridegroom, or, loving me, she has with
      the most culpable weakness allowed herself to be persuaded into an
      engagement with a man every way unworthy of her, to whom she is, to say
      the least, indifferent; and this, not in consequence of a lengthened
      persecution, but within twenty-four hours after I have left her, fondly
      deeming that had fate allowed me to ask her hand she would not have
      refused it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very strange, very unaccountable,&rdquo; returned Laura, musing, &ldquo;so much
      so, indeed, that I feel sure we do not yet know the whole truth, and that
      there must be some way of explaining her conduct satisfactorily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis shook his head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you will soon be able to judge for yourself, and
      will find that the view I take of the affair, gloomy as it may appear, is
      indeed the only true one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will dine with us to-day? Charles particularly wishes it; you must
      not refuse. Remember, it will be the last time for some weeks that I may
      have an opportunity of seeing you!&rdquo; pleaded Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know why I consent, except that it seems impossible to say no to
      you,&rdquo; returned Lewis, unable to resist the influence of Laura&rsquo;s
      sympathetic kindness. &ldquo;You will find me but a dull companion,&rdquo; he
      continued with a deep sigh, &ldquo;for your intelligence has completely unmanned
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take the chance of that,&rdquo; replied Laura with an incredulous
      smile; and so, shaking hands, they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner passed off heavily enough. Lewis, despite his efforts to the
      contrary, appeared out of spirits and <i>distrait</i>. Charles, having
      been cautioned and tutored to the utmost extent of female foresight as to
      what he was to say and what to avoid, grew nervous and puzzle-pated;
      called Laura, Annie, and asked Lewis why he did not send for Miss Grant
      (meaning his, Lewis&rsquo;s, sister Rose) to live with him and keep his house;
      by which blunders he provoked his wife to such a degree that she could
      have found in her heart to box his ears for him, without the smallest
      compunction. The arrival of &ldquo;Tarley&rdquo; and the dessert produced a marked
      improvement, that young gentleman being in the highest possible state of
      health and spirits, and influenced by a strong determination to partake of
      everything on the table, wine included, to ignore all established
      precedents as to eating jam by the intervention of a spoon, to consider
      walnuts appropriate missiles to throw at the company generally, and the
      cut-glass decanters in particular, to set maternal authority at defiance,
      as evinced by a resolution to pull off his left shoe and imbed it in
      orange marmalade, and in fact to do everything which appeared good in his
      eyes and naughty in those of his elders, and then and there to make a
      night of it. These little antics, at first amusing, and secretly
      patronised and fostered by Charles and Lewis, soon becoming tiresome, and
      at length unbearable, Laura asserted her prerogative, and disregarding
      much kicking and a hysterical affection, which was neither laughing nor
      crying, but a compound of the two, succeeded in carrying away her unruly
      offspring. When the gentlemen were left to themselves, Leicester, filling
      his glass and handing the bottle to Lewis, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mix much with the young men of the place, so as to judge of their
      political bias at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am acquainted with some dozen, or more, young artists, though I do not
      enter much into their pursuits, from want of inclination; although, at
      first, they pressed me to belong to their clubs. I should say, however,
      judging from their conversation, that democratic principles were rife
      among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear so; indeed, from information we have received, I should not be
      surprised if some attempt were likely to be made to throw off the Austrian
      yoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely that would be great folly,&rdquo; returned Lewis; &ldquo;with the troops and
      resources the Governor, Count Palffy, has at his command, any popular
      tumult might easily be quelled. It is only from cowardice or inaction on
      the part of the authorities that any of these successes in Northern Italy
      have been achieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but inaction is just what I fear,&rdquo; rejoined Leicester; &ldquo;the Austrians
      will not believe in the amount of popular disaffection which exists; they
      will go on ignoring the danger till the moment at which it could be most
      successfully combated has escaped them. Not that I care very much about
      the matter; I am neither Trojan nor Tyrian; but I am anxious to gain some
      certainty as to the chance of a popular outbreak, that I may take measures
      to provide for the safety of Laura and the child: besides, I think you are
      aware we have some guests coming to us; had I known this sooner I should
      have written to them to postpone their visit till some more favourable
      opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will investigate the matter,&rdquo; returned Lewis eagerly, &ldquo;and will
      communicate to you any information I may obtain; women should never be
      exposed to the chance of witnessing the horrors of street warfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After conversing on this topic for some minutes longer, the gentlemen,
      being neither of them addicted to the practice of wine-bibbing, followed
      Laura to the drawing-room. Lewis appeared silent and depressed, and a
      gloom hung over the little party which no effort on the part of the
      hostess could dispel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after ten o&rsquo;clock their guest rose to take leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall send Charles to you very often; and if possible, without
      attracting attention, I shall occasionally come with him,&rdquo; observed Laura;
      &ldquo;so mind you are not to freeze up again into a marble misanthrope: I
      consider I have improved you vastly since you have been under my tuition,
      and I by no means desire to have laboured in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have shown me kindness which I may never be able to repay,&rdquo; answered
      Lewis; &ldquo;but to prove that I neither forget nor feel ungrateful for it, I
      will struggle against the faults you so justly reprobate: if I sometimes
      fail, you must remember that it is difficult to preserve a cheerful, easy
      manner with an aching heart, and so pardon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having taken a cordial leave of his host and hostess, and refused
      Charles&rsquo;s offer of walking home with him, partly because he knew it would
      be an act of self-denial in his friend to relinquish his wife&rsquo;s society,
      partly because he wished to be alone, Lewis quitted the Palazzo Grassini
      and strolled on in the direction of his own abode. As he passed under the
      Piazza of St. Mark, a particularly beautiful effect of moonlight on the
      opposite buildings struck him, and leaning against one of the columns, he
      paused to observe it. The place where he was standing was in deep shadow,
      and to any one approaching from the left his figure was invisible, the
      massive column effectually hiding it. Having thoroughly fixed in his
      recollection the appearance which had attracted him, and which he proposed
      to transfer to canvas, he was about to quit the Piazza when a figure
      wrapped in a dark mantle advanced with a quick yet stealthy tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the new-comer approached the spot where Lewis was stationed a low
      whistle pierced the air, and immediately a second figure, also disguised
      in a dark robe, appeared from behind a pillar which had hitherto concealed
      him, and addressing the other, observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are late; I have waited for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The delay was unavoidable, Signor,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;I was forced to wait
      myself for Paulo, as until I had seen him I could not bring you the
      password.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is it?&rdquo; inquired the first speaker eagerly. The other glanced
      round with a suspicious air as he replied, &ldquo;I Martiri di Cosenza.&rdquo; *
    </p>
    <p>
      * The brothers Bandiera, two youths of high Patrician Venetian descent,
      were denounced to the Austrian government, and shot as conspirators at
      Cosenza, June 25th, 1844.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; was the rejoinder; &ldquo;and the place of meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great Hall of the Palazzo&mdash;iani,&rdquo; naming one of the many ruined
      palaces which are to be found in Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wisely chosen,&rdquo; observed the first speaker, who appeared of a rank
      superior to that of his companion; &ldquo;the time of meeting must be at hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Vossignoria proceeds thither leisurely, the hour will strike as you
      reach the appointed rendezvous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Now leave me; we must not be seen
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person addressed raised his cap as a token of respect, and turning,
      hurried from the spot&mdash;his confederate paused a moment as if in
      deliberation, and then strolled leisurely away in the direction of the
      Palazzo&mdash;iani. Lewis waited till the echoes of his retreating
      footsteps died away in the distance, then starting in the direction of his
      own dwelling, he walked with rapid strides till he reached the corner of
      one of the less-frequented streets; having done so, he struck down it,
      running at a pace which few could have kept up with till he approached his
      own house, when he again moderated his speed. Letting himself in with a
      private key, he entered his sitting-room, took a brace of small pistols
      from a drawer, loaded them carefully, and concealing them in a
      breast-pocket, flung a dark cloak over his shoulders and again quitted the
      room. His determination was taken. Accident having put him in possession
      of the time and place of some secret meeting, as well as the pass-word
      which he doubted not would ensure his admission, his love of adventure
      occasioned him instantly to resolve to be present at it. The assembly was
      doubtless of a political nature, and besides gratifying his taste for
      excitement, he might obtain some information in regard to the probability
      of a popular insurrection, and thus satisfy Leicester&rsquo;s anxiety for the
      safety of his wife and child&mdash;in which (though Lewis would not own
      the motive even to himself) might be involved that of Annie Grant. That
      the expedition he projected was a dangerous one he was well aware, but he
      trusted to chance and to his own tact and presence of mind to save him
      from discovery, and in case of these failing him, he possessed the pistols
      as a last resource. Twenty minutes&rsquo; brisk walking brought him beneath the
      walls of the Palazzo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing under the shadow of the building, he waited till he had seen two
      or three persons, carefully muffled up, proceeding in a particular
      direction. Conjecturing from their appearance and evident desire to escape
      observation that they were bound on the same errand as himself, he
      followed with a quick but noiseless step the next man who passed. This
      person walked on rapidly till he reached a small archway; here he stopped
      and looked round, as if to assure himself that he was not followed, when,
      perceiving Lewis, he seemed embarrassed, and after a moment&rsquo;s
      deliberation, during which he scrutinised the young artist&rsquo;s figure
      narrowly, he stationed himself in the centre of the path, as if to
      intercept Lewis&rsquo;s further progress. As he approached the stranger advanced
      a step to meet him, observing in Italian&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Signor walks late, and chooses a strange path; may I venture to
      inquire his object in so doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as your own,&rdquo; returned Lewis sternly; adding in a tone of
      command, &ldquo;We are too late already, lead the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person thus addressed, in whom, from a slight peculiarity in his
      accent, Lewis recognised him who had appeared the inferior of the two
      speakers whose conversation he had overheard in the Piazza of St. Mark,
      seemed for a moment undecided how to act; and then, either deceived by
      Lewis&rsquo;s manner, or purposing to postpone any further investigation till he
      should obtain the assistance of the other conspirators, he passed through
      the archway, and turning abruptly to the right hand, ran up a flight of
      stone steps terminated by a low door closely studded with large iron nail
      heads. Giving a low whistle, some one from within partially opened the
      door and the stranger entered, followed by Lewis. The moment he had done
      so, the door was shut and bolted behind him, and he found himself in total
      darkness; at the same instant he felt his arms pinioned by a powerful
      grasp, while a gruff voice exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the pass-word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I Martiri di Cosenza</i>,&rdquo; replied Lewis firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; was the rejoinder, as the grasp was removed from his arms, and
      the light of a dark lantern was thrown along the narrow stone passage in
      which Lewis now found himself. Having traversed this, a second door opened
      at his approach, a rush of cold air streamed upon him, and he found
      himself in a large dimly-lighted chamber, in which were assembled
      somewhere about thirty persons, who were gathered round a long table, at
      the upper end of which stood a man, who, with his arm extended, and his
      whole bearing indicative of strong excitement, was addressing the meeting.
      Drawing the collar of his cloak more over his face, and choosing a spot
      where the shadow of one of the heavy columns which supported the roof
      served in some measure to conceal him, Lewis joined the group. As he did
      so, the speaker, glancing with flashing eyes round the assembly, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are resolved, then&mdash;the cup is full to overflowing&mdash;we will
      bow no longer beneath the yoke of foreign tyrants. Our brethren in Milan
      have set us a glorious example&mdash;the accursed Austrian already
      trembles before their valour. Italy has shaken off her lethargy;&mdash;we
      have only to be true to ourselves and to the glorious cause, and liberty
      awaits our efforts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A subdued murmur of consent and approbation ran through the assembly, and
      the speaker continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus agreed, then, it only remains for us to <i>act</i>, and our first
      duty is to succour those who have suffered for our sakes. Those heroes,
      those martyrs to the cause of the Venetian people, Daniel Manin and
      Niccolo Tommaseo, languish in an unjust imprisonment; we will demand their
      liberation, and that with a voice that shall force the tyrants to listen&mdash;the
      voice of an awakened and indignant nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the speaker ceased, amidst a subdued buzz of approbation, a man in the
      dress of an artisan arose, and rolling his fierce blood-shot eyes around
      the assembly, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, brothers, we will liberate our brave compatriots&mdash;Manin and
      Tommaseo shall be set free to aid in the struggle for our liberty; but we
      must do more, Venice must rise and cast out those foreign butchers. A blow
      must be dealt which shall strike terror into their coward hearts; a blow
      which shall prove to them the fate they may expect, if they dare to
      oppress and withstand a people struggling for their freedom. And on whom
      can it so justly fall as on the arch-tyrant, sold hand and soul to
      Austria, thirsting only for vengeance and for murder&mdash;the base
      persecutor Marinovich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused; there was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and then a low whisper went round
      the assembly, &ldquo;Death to Marinovich!&rdquo; There was again a pause, and then men
      began to communicate with one another in deep muttered tones. After a
      short interval the first speaker, who had been writing rapidly, arose, and
      again addressing them, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are, then, agreed; and our first act shall be the liberation of Manin
      and Tommaseo. It is time that we disperse as silently and cautiously as
      may be; we must creep now that we may soar hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In order not to interrupt the thread of our narrative, we have described
      the proceedings as they occurred&mdash;we must now revert to Lewis. During
      the delivery of the first speech he observed that the man who had
      addressed him as he entered, and who appeared a tall, muscular young
      fellow, had contrived to place himself by his side, and was regarding him
      from time to time with looks of mistrust and suspicion. At the proposal
      for the assassination of Colonel Marinovich, the commandant at the
      Arsenal, a man who, though a strict disciplinarian, Lewis knew by report
      to be a brave and gallant officer, he had been unable to repress some
      slight sign of disapprobation. As he did so he perceived a scowl pass
      across the features of his watcher, who took the opportunity of drawing
      yet nearer to him, while an accidental movement revealed the unpleasant
      fact that he held in his hand a naked stiletto. As the president ended his
      final address, Lewis, who had kept his eye fixed on the features of his
      dangerous neighbour, felt convinced that the man only awaited the
      termination of the business proceedings to denounce him to his
      fellow-conspirators. With his usual coolness and decision in moments of
      danger, Lewis saw that his only chance of safety lay in taking the
      initiative; accordingly, catching the man&rsquo;s eye, he fixed on him a
      piercing glance, as he said in a stern whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first word you utter aloud you are a dead man;&rdquo; at the same moment he
      presented the muzzle of a pistol within an inch of his ear. The man
      started slightly and attempted to increase the distance between them, but
      Lewis laid an iron grasp on his collar and detained him; having stood for
      a moment irresolute, he said, in the same low whisper in which Lewis had
      addressed him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an Austrian spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; returned Lewis; &ldquo;I am an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other again started, regarded him fixedly, and then resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear by all you hold sacred never to reveal that which you have learned
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will swear nothing, except to blow out your brains if you attempt to
      speak or move without my permission,&rdquo; was the stern, uncompromising
      rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger&rsquo;s lip quivered and his grasp tightened on the stiletto, but
      he caught the glance of Lewis&rsquo;s flashing eyes and felt that he was in
      earnest, and that his life hung upon a thread. The members of the secret
      association were by this time noiselessly gliding away in parties of two
      and three, and Lewis, fearing if he remained too long he might attract the
      attention of the president, who still continued writing at the table,
      determined to depart; accordingly, he said in a low whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we will go&mdash;precede me; but if I observe you attempt, by word or
      sign, to betray me, that moment I shoot you like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, who seemed by this time sullenly to have resigned himself to
      his fate, or possibly to be reserving his strength for the execution of
      some scheme which he had devised for the future, obeyed in silence, and
      left the vault closely followed by Lewis, who still retained a firm grasp
      of his collar, although the ample folds of his cloak prevented the fact
      from being observed. In this manner they reached the door at the top of
      the stairs, and here were stationed two brawny-limbed, ruffianly-looking
      fellows, who acted in the double capacity of porter and sentry. Their
      attention, however, appeared solely directed to prevent the intrusion of
      any unwelcome visitant, the advisability of refusing egress to any one who
      had already passed their scrutiny never seeming to occur to them. This
      Lewis felt to be the deciding moment of his fate; once outside the gate he
      would be in comparative safety. Pressing the muzzle of the pistol against
      the back of his companion&rsquo;s neck by way of a gentle hint, he muttered,
      &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man shuddered slightly as the cold iron touched him, but made no
      reply. As they reached the gateway, the janitor stationed on the left
      side, addressing Lewis&rsquo;s companion, made some inquiry in a low voice.
      Glancing round appealingly, as if to indicate that he was forced, even for
      their common safety, to reply, he spoke a few words in a dialect Lewis did
      not comprehend, when the gate-keeper respectfully held the wicket open and
      they passed out. And now once again Lewis felt that he was a free man, and
      he inwardly congratulated himself on having escaped so great peril, which
      congratulations were, as the event proved, somewhat premature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having descended the steps, Lewis loosened his hold on the stranger&rsquo;s
      collar, saying carelessly, as he replaced his pistol in his breast&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, young gentleman; thanks to your prudence and my precaution of
      bringing a brace of pistols with me, I have drawn my head out of the
      lion&rsquo;s mouth without having it bitten off for my pains. But now I want to
      have a little serious conversation with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till we are further from the Palazzo&mdash;iani, then,&rdquo; was the
      reply, in a voice that yet trembled from excitement or some other deep
      emotion; &ldquo;we may be overheard; keep more in the shade of the buildings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suspecting no treachery, Lewis complied. Scarcely had he done so, however,
      when he fancied he heard a stealthy footstep following him, and turning
      abruptly, found himself face to face with a tall, savage-looking ruffian,
      who, armed with a naked stiletto, was evidently meditating mischief.
      Confused by his sudden motion, the fellow stood for a moment irresolute;
      not so his intended victim. The path along which he had been proceeding
      followed the course of one of the smaller <i>rii</i> or canals by which
      Venice is in so many directions intersected. Availing himself of this
      circumstance, Lewis rolled his cloak round his arm and sprang upon his
      assailant, parrying, with the shield thus constituted, a hasty and
      ineffectual stab which the other made at him. Foiled in his attempt, the
      ruffian drew back to avoid Lewis&rsquo;s onset, thereby approaching incautiously
      too near the bank of the canal. His antagonist was not slow to perceive
      the opportunity thus afforded him. Following up his retreating foe so as
      to prevent him from turning to perceive his danger, he waited till the man
      reached the brink of the canal, then stretching out his foot, he tripped
      him up, and parrying a second stab as he had done the former one, pushed
      him over the bank, which at that part was somewhat steep. A heavy fall and
      a loud splash in the water announced that his stratagem had succeeded, but
      at the same moment he felt his throat compressed by a powerful grasp, a
      naked stiletto flashed before him, and the eyes of the young conspirator,
      burning with hatred and revenge, glared at him through the darkness with
      the ferocity of those of some savage animal. Up to this point Lewis&rsquo;s
      courage and self-possession had never for a moment failed him, but now a
      strange, wild idea occurred to him, and a horrible dread suddenly
      overwhelmed him: his senses reeled, his limbs trembled, and for the first
      time in his life he experienced the mental agony of fear. Instinctively he
      seized the uplifted wrist of his assailant, and gazed with starting
      eye-balls at his face, on which the cold moonlight streamed. Yes! there
      could be no doubt: in the features of the being with whom he was engaged
      in deadly conflict he recognised a dark, shadowy, but most unmistakable
      resemblance to Hardy the poacher. Was it incipient madness, or was he thus
      horribly to be convinced of the reality of tales which he had hitherto
      deemed the mere drivellings of superstition?&mdash;could the dead indeed
      rise from their graves to seek vengeance on their slayers?
    </p>
    <p>
      As these thoughts flashed meteor-like through his brain, his antagonist
      made a violent but ineffectual effort to free his wrist, and this action
      in great measure restored Lewis&rsquo;s self-possession. Ghosts had not thews
      and sinews, and even in that moment of peril a flush of shame at his
      childish terror spread over his brow, and the impulse seemed to rend
      redoubled vigour to his frame. Consequently the struggle, though severe,
      was short. Superior in strength to his assailant, Lewis, having succeeded
      in wresting the dagger from his grasp, hurled it into the canal, leaving
      him completely unarmed and at his mercy. The stranger was the first to
      speak. Folding his arms across his breast with an air of dogged
      resolution, he said, speaking for the first time in English, and without
      the slightest foreign accent&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were wrong to throw away that weapon; it would have done your work as
      effectually and more silently than the pistol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You consider your life as forfeit, then?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you to do by me as I would have done by you,&rdquo; was the concise
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no assassin,&rdquo; returned Lewis coldly; &ldquo;and that reminds me of your
      worthy associate. You engaged my attention, so that I am ignorant whether
      he sank or swam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear for honest Jacopo,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;he follows the calling of
      a gondolier when his stiletto is not in requisition, and can swim like a
      fish. Look yonder; he has gained the shore, and is even now watching us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Lewis observed a tall figure crouching under a projecting
      portion of the bank of the canal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not molest you further,&rdquo; continued his late antagonist; &ldquo;once
      foiled in his spring, like the tiger, he will not renew the attack. Had he
      slain you I should have paid him five <i>zwanzigers</i>; as it is, the
      poor fellow will only get his ducking for his pains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he follow us?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you entered I gave him a hint not to let you pass on your return;
      had he attempted to stop you, however, I believed you would shoot me,
      therefore, thinking I could obtain your death or capture without losing my
      own life, I gave him a glance by which he knew he was not to interrupt
      you. He then asked me in the thieves&rsquo; patois of this place what he was to
      do, and I told him to <i>follow</i> us, as you were a spy. You know the
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis paused for a moment, and then said abruptly, &ldquo;You are an
      Englishman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will accompany me to my rooms,&rdquo; rejoined Lewis; &ldquo;I would question you
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will learn at the fitting time,&rdquo; returned Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if I refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will summon the police, and if you attempt to escape, I will shoot you
      through the head,&rdquo; was the stern rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; replied the stranger; &ldquo;but I warn you I will not be
      arrested: my liberty is dear to me, my life I hold cheap&mdash;so cheap
      that even now, unarmed as I am, and unequal to you in muscular strength, I
      am tempted again to rush on you and try the chances of a death-struggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would advise you not to do so,&rdquo; returned Lewis calmly; &ldquo;besides,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I may be more disposed to befriend you than you are aware of&mdash;it
      is with no hostile purpose I thus force you to accompany me, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will trust you,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Your looks and words have, I know not
      why, a strange power over me&mdash;you must possess the gift of the <i>Malocchio</i>,
      which these Italians believe in&mdash;it was your glance, far more than
      your pistol, which kept me silent in the chamber of meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During almost the whole of this conversation they had been walking side by
      side in the direction of the street in which Lewis&rsquo;s studio was situated,
      and in another five minutes they reached it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I your word of honour that you will not again attempt my life, or
      seek to escape till our interview is concluded?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; was the concise reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me, then,&rdquo; continued Lewis; and drawing a key from his pocket, he
      unfastened the door, entered, closed it again, and accompanied by the
      stranger, led the way through the painting-room into his study.

      CHAPTER LVII.&mdash;WALTER SEES A GHOST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ewis, having
      lighted a powerful lamp by the aid of which he was accustomed to paint at
      night, was enabled to take a more particular survey of his new
      acquaintance than circumstances had yet permitted. He was a tall,
      powerfully-built stripling, with a dark complexion and handsome features,
      but although he could scarcely have numbered twenty years, his face wore a
      prematurely old expression, and there was a wild, reckless look in his
      eyes which told of a spirit ill at ease. He wore a sailor&rsquo;s dress, though
      the materials of which it was composed were of a finer quality than
      ordinary; he coldly refused the chair which Lewis offered him, and folding
      his arms across his breast, waited to be questioned. Lewis in the meantime
      took his seat at the table, placed the pistols on the desk before him, and
      fixing his piercing glance on the face of his captive, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My knowledge of you is this: I find you an active and zealous member of a
      conspiracy to overthrow the Austrian Government in this city&mdash;one of
      a set of conspirators whose first act is to be the assassination of
      Colonel Marinovich, commandant of the Arsenal. As far as I am concerned,
      you first resolved to denounce me to your associates as a spy; foiled in
      that attempt, you incite an accomplice to murder me, and on his failure,
      use your best endeavours to stab me yourself; in the struggle I disarm
      you, and you find yourself in the power of the man for whose blood you
      have been thirsting. Even allowing, for the sake of argument, that you
      were justified in seeking the life of one who might betray your treasonous
      designs, you still remain a convicted conspirator, and my natural course
      would be to hand you over to the police; for your threat of never being
      taken alive is absurd, since you lost your stiletto I could have captured
      you at any moment I pleased. However, the fact of your being an Englishman
      interests me in your behalf, and if you will answer my questions frankly
      and truly, I may be induced to let you off. In the first place, tell me
      who you are, and enough of your former life to enable me to understand how
      I find you thus plotting with foreigners with whom you can have no
      feelings in common, for an evil purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can soon satisfy you, if that is all you require,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;My
      life has from its commencement been a curse to myself and to others. Wrong
      has produced wrong; I was badly brought up, and I have turned out badly; I
      am not the first that has done so, nor shall I be the last. At the age
      when most children are carefully trained to good, I was as sedulously
      instructed in evil. At twelve years old I could swear, game, and drink,
      and my instructors laughed to see the boy aping the vices of the man. My
      mother died in giving me birth; my father, I know not why, never loved me:
      he used me cruelly, and I hated him for it; so I left my home and worked
      for four years on board a man-of-war. At the end of that time the ship was
      paid off. Seeking pleasure, I fell into vicious company; squandered, and
      was robbed of my pay, and for some weeks I wandered a houseless beggar
      through London streets. The chance kindness of a stranger rescued me from
      that state of wretchedness&rdquo;&mdash;a peculiar expression flitted across the
      features of his auditor as he mentioned the fact of his rescue from
      beggary; not observing it, he continued: &ldquo;I then entered the
      merchant-service, and speedily rose to the rank of mate. The misery I had
      undergone rendered me more careful. I saved money, studied my profession,
      and hoped in time to become a captain of a merchantman. I embarked the
      whole of my savings in a trading speculation which would more than have
      doubled them, when the ship containing my property was wrecked. I was
      picked up by a vessel bound to this port, and was landed here again a
      beggar; and after trying in vain to procure any better situation, I have
      been forced to work in the arsenal as a common labourer to save myself
      from starvation. But even there my ill-fortune and the cruelty and
      injustice of men followed me. Peculation to a great extent was discovered
      amongst the workmen; I was examined before Colonel Marinovich; in vain I
      protested my innocence. God knows I have committed sins enough; but
      thieving and lying were never among them. However, I was condemned to
      receive forty lashes. Yes, sir; I, an Englishman, innocent of the crime of
      which I was accused, was beaten like a slave by the orders of a tyrannical
      foreigner; and now, perhaps, you can tell what took me to the meeting
      to-night? It was the hope of revenge, and there were others there with the
      same deadly purpose. The man who proposed the assassination of Marinovich
      was innocent as myself, and like me had smarted beneath the tyrant&rsquo;s lash.
      You by revealing this plot threatened to cheat us of our just revenge, and
      for that reason I would have sacrificed your life. And now you know my
      history, what will you do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause ere Lewis, fixing his eyes on him with a clear,
      penetrating glance, said slowly and impressively, &ldquo;There are a few minor
      particulars which appear to have escaped your memory; I will try to supply
      the deficiency. You were born in the village of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      in H&mdash;&mdash;shire. Your early instructors in evil were the worthless
      characters who accompanied your father on his poaching expeditions. You
      left home because in a drunken mood your father struck you, and would not
      confess afterwards that he was sorry for so doing. You would have run away
      sooner but for your affection for your sister Jane. The stranger who
      rescued you from beggary was a young man who met you by chance at the door
      of a house in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Street, Russell Square; you
      begged of him in Italian; the merchant-ship in which you served, to whose
      commander he gave you an introduction, was the &lsquo;Beauty,&rsquo; of Southsea,
      Captain Singleton, and your own name is Miles Hardy. Am I not correct in
      these particulars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lewis began speaking his companion&rsquo;s attention became riveted. As he
      proceeded his surprise grew deeper and deeper; but when he mentioned his
      name he sprang forward, and regarding him with wildly gleaming eyes,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Tell me, what are you? man or devil? who thus know every
      secret of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no devil,&rdquo; returned Lewis, smiling, &ldquo;but a mortal like yourself; you
      have seen me before; look well at me; do you not recognise me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, the young man carefully scanned his features, and then,
      in a low, hesitating voice, rejoined, &ldquo;You are, or I am much mistaken, the
      gentleman who rescued me from beggary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;we are both much changed since that
      night, but I knew you at the moment you seized me by the throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, I did not succeed in taking your life!&rdquo; exclaimed Miles Hardy
      earnestly; &ldquo;you are almost the only person who has ever shown me
      disinterested kindness; and how have I sought to repay it! Oh, sir, can
      you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The simple fact that you did not recognise me exonerates you from the
      charge of ingratitude, my poor fellow,&rdquo; returned Lewis kindly; &ldquo;but now
      sit down. Ere I can explain to you how I gained the knowledge which has so
      much surprised you, you have a long tale to listen to, and one which will
      cause you much sorrow. You turn pale; wait, I will get you a glass of
      wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;I have fasted long; it will pass away in
      a moment;&rdquo; but as he spoke he sank heavily into a chair which stood beside
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis produced from a cupboard food and wine, and placing them before him,
      induced him to partake of some refreshment, and soon had the satisfaction
      of seeing the light return to his eye and the colour to his cheek. Lewis
      then filled for himself a glass of wine, replenished that of his
      companion, and seating himself, hastened to relate to Miles Hardy the
      strange train of events by means of which he had become acquainted with so
      large a portion of the young man&rsquo;s history. The feelings with which Miles
      Hardy listened to the account of his unhappy father&rsquo;s career, and the
      mingled grief and anger with which he heard how the heritage of his
      mother&rsquo;s shame had descended to his unfortunate sister, may easily be
      imagined. Lewis strove with an amount of patient kindness, for which those
      who knew only the fiery side of his character would scarcely have given
      him credit, to soothe the passionate emotions which his tale excited in an
      auditor so deeply interested in the fortunes of those to whom it related.
      After long perseverance his efforts were in some degree crowned with
      success&mdash;Miles became more calm, and agreed with Lewis that his first
      duty was to seek for, and endeavour to reclaim, his sister. His share of
      the legacy would furnish him with funds sufficient to enable him to live
      without the necessity of daily labour, and until his right to the money
      should be established, Lewis insisted on becoming his banker. The next
      question was not so easily arranged: Lewis informed Miles that in regard
      to the events of the evening he had arrived at the following determination&mdash;viz.,
      to call on Colonel Marinovich, make him acquainted with the plot against
      his life, beg him to inform his superiors that such a conspiracy was on
      foot, and explain the manner in which he had become aware of its
      existence; but as far as Miles was concerned in the affair, he would
      promise to preserve a total silence, on one condition&mdash;namely, that
      he, Miles, should withdraw from the conspiracy and engage to keep the
      peace in regard to the commandant of the Arsenal. To this proposition the
      young man demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;give up my just revenge!&mdash;submit to undeserved
      chastisement like a beaten hound, and leave it to less tame and slavish
      spirits to punish the tyrant for his cruelty!&mdash;allow them to meet the
      danger and divide the glory while I stand by inactive! Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Miles,&rdquo; returned Lewis earnestly, &ldquo;revenge, even just
      revenge, partakes of the nature of sin, and brings upon him who obtains it
      the curse of an upbraiding conscience. But yours is not a just revenge;
      you have suffered wrong, and the sense of this blinds your judgment. I
      know by report the character of this Marinovich; I know him to be a just
      and honourable man, though a stern disciplinarian. Great abuses had
      existed at the Arsenal, and it was in order to reform them that the
      command was bestowed on him. In your individual case he has acted
      unjustly, but in all probability appearances were strongly against you,
      and he had not sufficient personal acquaintance with you to know that
      amongst such inveterate liars as are the majority of the lower order of
      Venetians, your word might be relied on. His only fault is, therefore,
      that he committed an error in judgment, and would you on this account take
      a man&rsquo;s life? Besides, conniving at assassination is a cowardly
      proceeding, unworthy any Englishman, and especially a brave young fellow
      like yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Lewis&rsquo;s reasoning was not without its effect on him
      whom he addressed, for his brow contracted, his fingers closed and
      relaxed, his mouth quivered convulsively, and his whole demeanour was that
      of a person struggling against some powerful temptation. At length he
      exclaimed abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not how it is, you sway me like a child. I had resolved not to
      rest till that man was dead, but I never before saw the matter in the
      light in which you have now placed it. I believed that his death would be
      an act of justice, and considered that, in order to obtain justice, we
      must take the law into our own hands&mdash;but I feel the truth of what
      you say, that assassination is cowardly; I felt it when Jacopo was dogging
      your footsteps, and but for the cause that was at stake, could have found
      in my heart to warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will agree to my proposal?&rdquo; inquired Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will agree to withdraw from the conspiracy, but it is at the risk
      of my life that I do so; if I am found in Venice after my desertion is
      known, I am a dead man. Moreover, I will promise you to abstain from
      secretly attempting Marinovich&rsquo;s life; but if I should ever meet him face
      to face and hand to hand, I will teach him to remember having flogged an
      Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis felt that in his new character of Mentor he ought to combat this
      openly declared resolution, but he abstained from doing so, partly because
      he felt it would be useless, and partly because he sympathised so
      completely in the sentiment, that he could not muster sufficient hypocrisy
      to reprove it. Accordingly he remained satisfied with the concession he
      had gained, and furnishing Miles with all the information he possessed in
      regard to his sister, which was but vague and unsatisfactory (a rumour
      that she had passed some time in Rome on her first arrival in that country
      being the only trace he had yet been able to discover of her proceedings),
      Lewis gave him an introduction to an agent whom he had employed to gain
      further tidings, and forcing a sum of money upon him more than sufficient
      to defray his expenses, hastened his departure ere the brilliant rays of
      an Italian sun had spread the lustre of the coming day throughout the
      picturesque old streets and palace-crowned squares of Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning Lewis fulfilled his intention of calling on
      Colonel Marinovich, who heard his recital in silence, and when he had
      concluded, thanked him for his information, said he was aware great
      disaffection existed amongst the men employed at the Arsenal, and that
      energetic measures must be taken to prevent its spreading further,
      promised to report the discovery of the secret meeting to the Governor,
      took down Lewis&rsquo;s address, and politely bowed him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having despatched a note to Charles Leicester telling him he wished to see
      him, Lewis debated with himself how much of the previous night&rsquo;s adventure
      he should reveal to him, and at length decided that it would be more
      prudent to avoid mentioning his encounter with and recognition of Miles
      Hardy, as although he had refused to reveal to him the name of the seducer
      of his sister, yet any reference to an affair in which Lord Bellefield had
      so singularly misconducted himself must necessarily be painful to
      Leicester. Moreover, although in his dealings with Miles Hardy Lewis had
      acted justly, according to the best of his judgment, he was by no means
      clear that the law might take the same view of the matter. Charley came&mdash;listened
      to his friend&rsquo;s account&mdash;yawned&mdash;wondered why he had such a
      strange predilection for putting his life in danger, prophesying that he
      would do it once too often and be sorry for it afterwards&mdash;expected
      there would be a shindy in Venice before long&mdash;wished Laura and the
      brat were safe in England, and that the other people were not coming&mdash;voted
      it all an awful bore&mdash;asked Lewis whether he liked foreign tailoring,
      into the merits and demerits whereof he entered at some length&mdash;yawned
      again, and patting him affectionately on the back, told him to take better
      care of himself for the future, and lounged carelessly out of the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed away. The Grant party had arrived; Annie, although she made
      a great effort to appear in her former spirits, was evidently labouring
      under some ailment, mental or bodily, or both combined, which was wearing
      away her youth, and, as it appeared, changing her whole nature. Laura, who
      watched her closely, observed that she was unusually silent and
      abstracted, falling into long reveries, from which she would awake with a
      start, and glancing round with a half-frightened air, would immediately
      begin talking in an unnaturally excited manner, as if to do away with any
      suspicion to which her silence might have given rise. Her temper also,
      which had been remarkable for its sweetness, had now become uncertain, and
      she occasionally answered even the General with a wayward captiousness
      which surprised Laura only one degree less than the preternatural meekness
      with which that gallant officer submitted to her caprices and indulged her
      every whim; but the fact was, General Grant had sufficient acuteness to
      perceive that for some cause, utterly beyond the scope of his philosophy
      to account for, his daughter was not the quiet, gentle, <i>will-less</i>
      creature she had been, and that if he required her to yield to him in
      great matters he must allow her to rule in small. Moreover, he had lately
      become seriously alarmed about her health; a London physician whom he had
      consulted on the subject having plainly told him unless great caution was
      observed she would go into a decline, and warned him that the seat of the
      disease appeared to be in the mind, and that anything like harshness or
      opposition must be avoided. Walter also was much changed during the two
      years which had elapsed. In appearance he was now a young man, tall, and
      slightly but gracefully formed, with well-cut, regular features, though a
      want of intellectual expression marred what might otherwise have been
      considered a handsome countenance. But considerable as was the alteration
      in his personal appearance, the change in his mental capacity was equally
      perceivable, his powers of mind had developed to a greater degree than had
      been anticipated, but alas! deprived of Lewis&rsquo;s firm yet gentle rule, the
      improvement in his disposition had by no means kept pace with the
      extension of his faculties. For some weeks after Lewis had quitted
      Broadhurst, poor Walter could not be persuaded that he would not come back
      again, nor was it till the arrival of a tutor, recommended by Lord
      Bellefield, that he fully realised the fact of his friend having left him
      never to return. The first effect this conviction produced upon him was a
      fit of deep dejection; he refused all attempts at consolation, could
      scarcely be persuaded to take nourishment, and sat hour after hour playing
      listlessly with the wavy curls of Faust&rsquo;s shaggy coat. At length, in order
      to rouse him, General Grant desired the dog to be taken away from him; the
      remedy proved only too effectual. The new tutor, a certain Mr. Spooner,
      who appeared as if he had been selected because he was in every respect
      the exact reverse of Lewis, was the person to whom the General entrusted
      this commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in his own sad thoughts, Walter allowed him to coax the dog from
      his side by the attraction of a plate of meat, but when he laid his hand
      on the animal to buckle a collar and chain round his neck, he started up,
      exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with Faust? he is never tied up; let him alone.&rdquo;
       Finding that his remonstrance was not attended to, he continued, &ldquo;Faust!
      Faust! come here, sir, directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog struggled to obey, but Mr. Spooner, having fastened the chain
      round his neck, endeavoured to force him out of the room, and in doing so
      stepped accidentally on Faust&rsquo;s toes, who uttered a shrill yelp of pain.
      Walter&rsquo;s eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hurting him,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;how dare you!&rdquo; and without waiting for a
      reply, he darted across the room, seized the astonished Mr. Spooner, who,
      unfortunately for himself, happened to be a small, slightly-framed man, by
      the throat, and shook him till his teeth chattered; then suddenly
      releasing him, he snatched the chain from his grasp, and leading the dog
      away, muttered in a threatening tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you touch Faust again; if you do, I&rsquo;ll strangle you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The results of this scene were twofold: Walter had rebelled and gained his
      point, and the person whom he had thus conquered had lost all chance of
      obtaining that degree of ascendency over him without which his control
      must become merely nominal. This produced, as might be expected, the worst
      possible effect upon poor Walter&rsquo;s disposition. He became positive and
      wilful in the extreme, and his tutor, partly to save himself trouble,
      partly to avoid any outbreak of temper, gave way to him on every occasion;
      unless, indeed, he had any particular personal interest at stake, when he
      sought to gain his point by cajolery and manoeuvring, and being rather an
      adept in those ingenious arts, was usually successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      One new and inconvenient caprice of Walter&rsquo;s was a dislike which he
      appeared suddenly to have taken to Annie Grant, which displayed itself in
      various ways: sometimes he would avoid all intercourse with her, even
      sulkily refusing to answer her when she spoke to him; at others he would
      seek her out and endeavour to annoy her by saying what he deemed sharp
      things. Occasionally, however, he would fall into his old habits, and
      confide in her as his playmate, from whom he was sure of sympathy and
      assistance; when suddenly, perhaps, even in the midst of some conversation
      with her, he would appear to recollect his new-born animosity, and his
      manner would entirely alter. One thing invariably excited his extreme
      indignation, and this was any attempt on her part to caress or notice
      Faust. The pain this altered demeanour caused Annie (perhaps in
      consequence of some theory which she had formed as to its origin) was
      known but to her own heart, and could be guessed at merely by her
      unwearying efforts to conciliate poor Walter. Laura, upon whose
      quick-sightedness nothing was lost, carefully noted these changes, and
      made her own private comments upon them. In pursuance of her design of
      befriending Lewis, she made several attempts to penetrate the veil of
      reserve which hung around Annie Grant; but in vain: with her lightness of
      heart seemed also to have departed her openness of disposition, and Laura
      had too much good taste, as well as too much sympathy with her grief, to
      endeavour to force her confidence. At length one day, as Laura and Annie
      were sitting together, Laura working zealously at some article of juvenile
      finery, destined unconsciously to foster the seeds of incipient dandyism
      already apparent in that embryo man-about-town &ldquo;Tarley,&rdquo; and Annie
      listlessly turning over the pages of a novel, from which her thoughts were
      far away, the elder lady suddenly broke silence by observing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tarley&rsquo; will be two years old to-morrow; how the time slips away, it
      really seems impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie&rsquo;s only reply was a deep sigh, and Laura continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Annie, you&rsquo;ll be of age in a month&mdash;four short weeks more, and
      you will actually have arrived at years of discretion. How wise you ought
      to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding Annie still remained silent, Laura only waited till she had passed
      some interesting crisis in her stitching, and then looked up. To her alarm
      and surprise she beheld the &ldquo;big tears&rdquo; silently coursing each other down
      her friend&rsquo;s pale cheeks: in an instant she was by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie, dearest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are weeping; what is it? Have I said or
      done anything to pain you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie slightly shook her head in token of dissent, and made an effort to
      check her tears, which proving ineffectual, eventuated in a bitter sob.
      Laura could not stand the sight of her grief; throwing her arms round her,
      she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie, you are miserable; I see, I know you are; and your unhappiness is
      wearing you to death. Why will you not confide in me? Perhaps I might help
      you. What is it, darling? will you not tell me?&rdquo; She paused for a reply,
      but obtaining none, continued: &ldquo;This marriage with Lord Bellefield, it is
      distasteful to you, I am afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder which passed through poor Annie&rsquo;s frame as Laura mentioned the
      name of her intended husband proved that on this point her suspicions had
      not erred. Fancying she now saw her way more clearly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;do not afflict yourself thus; you must not, shall
      not marry him. I will speak to the General myself. Charles shall write to
      his brother; you shall not be sacrificed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; interrupted Annie, struggling to recover composure; &ldquo;you do
      not know what you say. I <i>must</i> marry him; there is no alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say so, Annie,&rdquo; returned Laura gravely; &ldquo;marriage is a sacred
      thing, not lightly to be entered into; and in marriage one requisite alone
      is indispensable&mdash;love! Tastes may differ, faults of temper or
      disposition may exist; yet if man and wife truly love each other, they
      will be very happy; but to marry without love is a grievous sin, and it
      entails its own punishment&mdash;wretchedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura spoke solemnly and with feeling, and her companion, as she listened,
      trembled and turned pale. When she had concluded, however, Annie merely
      shook her head, repeating hopelessly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>must</i> be&mdash;it <i>must</i> be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, pray, why must it be?&rdquo; asked Laura quickly, for she was becoming
      slightly provoked at that which she deemed Annie&rsquo;s childish weakness, the
      only fault, perhaps, with which her clear head, warm heart, and earnest,
      zealous nature unfitted her to sympathise. &ldquo;Why, if the thing is wrong in
      itself, and is to render you miserable, <i>must</i> it be? At all events
      let us make some efforts to prevent it; suffer Charles and me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Laura,&rdquo; interrupted Annie mournfully, &ldquo;I assure you nothing can
      be done; any attempt to break off the match now would be unavailing and
      only end in making me still more wretched than I am at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annoyed alike at her perseverance in that which Laura could not but
      consider a culpable want of moral courage, and at the way in which she
      still withheld her confidence, while at the same time the idea occurred to
      her, though she was vexed with herself for admitting it, that one so
      feeble-minded was no fitting bride for the high-souled, brave-hearted
      Lewis, the spirited little matron was about to utter a somewhat sharp
      reply, when, glancing at Annie&rsquo;s pale, beautifully-formed features, the
      expression of deep anguish she read there disarmed her, and merely saying,
      &ldquo;We take different views of this matter, Annie dear, and must talk of it
      again when we are both more composed,&rdquo; she rose and left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie waited until the sound of the closing door assured her that she was
      alone, and then murmuring, &ldquo;She too is angry with me and despises me&mdash;nobody
      loves me. Oh, that I were dead!&rdquo; »he hid her face in the sofa cushion and
      gave way to a passionate burst of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there is one of our <i>dramatis personæ</i> for whom we have reason to
      believe many of our readers entertain a warm regard&mdash;a regard in
      which we confess ourselves fully to participate&mdash;of whom we have
      lately heard but little; of course we refer to that most &ldquo;meritorious
      individual,&rdquo; that dog of dogs, dear, honest old Faust. Since Lewis had
      quitted Broadhurst Faust&rsquo;s character, like those of his betters (if
      mortals <i>are</i> better than dogs), had in a degree altered. The blind,
      unhesitating obedience he had been accustomed to pay to his master&rsquo;s
      slightest signal he accorded to no other person; if Walter called him he
      would come, it is true, but he would do so in the calm, leisurely,
      dignified manner in which one gentleman would comply with the request of
      another. Towards the General he conducted himself with a degree of
      respectful hauteur which seemed to say, &ldquo;We are not friends; there is no
      sympathy between us, but as long as I continue to reside in a family of
      which you are the head, I owe it to myself to render you the amount of
      courtesy due to your position.&rdquo; For Mr. Spooner, the usurper who had dared
      to succeed his beloved master, he showed a most unmitigated contempt,
      totally ignoring all his commands, and resenting any attempt on his part
      to enforce his authority by the utterance of a low, deep growl,
      accompanied by a formidable display of sharp white teeth. Towards Annie
      alone did he evince any great affection, which he showed chiefly by
      attending her in her walks and taking up his position under the sofa, or
      close to the chair on which she was sitting&mdash;demonstrations of
      attachment which, as we have already hinted, were for some unexplained
      reason a source of considerable annoyance to Walter. During the
      conversation between Laura and Annie, Faust had been lying unnoticed under
      the sofa, and now finding his young mistress alone, and for some cause or
      other unhappy (he knew <i>that</i> quite well), it occurred to him that
      the correct thing would be to come out and comfort her, which he attempted
      to do by laying his great rough head in her lap, wagging his tail
      encouragingly, and licking her hand. In her loneliness of heart even the
      poor dog&rsquo;s sympathy (endeared to her as he was by a thousand cherished
      recollections) was a relief to Annie, and stooping down she imprinted a
      kiss on his shaggy head, whispering as she did so, &ldquo;Good Faust&mdash;you
      have never forsaken me!&rdquo; At this moment the door opened, and Walter
      entered hastily. As his eye fell upon Annie and the dog his cheeks
      flushed, and he exclaimed hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie, I wish you&rsquo;d let Faust alone; how often have I told you that I
      won&rsquo;t have him meddled with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a start at this sudden interruption Annie hastily raised herself, and
      pushing the dog gently from her, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Walter, do not be angry; Faust came and licked my hand, you would
      not have me unkind to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s Faust&rsquo;s fault, is it?&rdquo; returned Walter crossly. &ldquo;Faust, come
      here! Take him to our room, Mr. Spooner, and keep him there till I come;
      he shall not stay in the drawing-room if he does what I don&rsquo;t like. Faust,
      do you hear me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will never follow me, Sir Walter; it&rsquo;s no use calling him,&rdquo;
       remonstrated Mr. Spooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will do as I tell him, and so will you too,&rdquo; returned Walter
      imperiously, and twisting his handkerchief, he tied it round the dog&rsquo;s
      neck, led him to the door, gave the end of the leash thus formed to Mr.
      Spooner, and then fairly turned the pair of them out of the room. Having
      accomplished this feat, he strolled listlessly to the fireplace, and
      amused himself by pulling about the ornaments on the chimney-piece for
      some minutes. At length a new idea seemed to strike him, and turning to
      his companion, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I was so angry with Faust just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was petting him, I suppose, as you don&rsquo;t seem to like me to do
      so,&rdquo; returned Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that was not all, though,&rdquo; rejoined Walter; &ldquo;I wanted him
      particularly to have been with me when I was out walking to-day, very
      particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and why was that?&rdquo; inquired Annie, who always encouraged him to talk
      to her, in the hope of overcoming the dislike which he had taken to her,
      and which, for many reasons, pained her inexpressibly. Walter remained for
      a minute or two silent, and then coming close to her, he asked in a low
      whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie, do you believe in ghosts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Walter, what an odd question,&rdquo; returned Annie in surprise; &ldquo;why
      do you ask it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter glanced carefully round the room, to assure himself that they were
      alone ere he replied, in the same low, awe-stricken whisper, &ldquo;Because, if
      there are such things, I think I&rsquo;ve seen one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly boy,&rdquo; rejoined Annie, anxious to reassure him, for she saw that he
      was really frightened, &ldquo;you have fancied it. What was your ghost like,
      pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise you won&rsquo;t tell anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie, half amused, half puzzled by the boy&rsquo;s earnestness, gave the
      required pledge. As soon as she had done so, Walter, stooping down so as
      to bring his mouth on a level with her ear, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the ghost of Mr. Arundel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Overcome by so unexpected a reply, Annie was a moment or so before she
      could find words to inquire, &ldquo;My dear Walter, what could make you imagine
      such a thing? Perhaps you were asleep, and dreamed it&mdash;when was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was not asleep; and it was not fancy,&rdquo; returned Walter gravely. &ldquo;I
      was out walking this morning early with Mr. Spooner, and we lost our way,
      and after trying for some time to find it, Mr. Spooner hired a boat, and
      told the boatman to set us down near&mdash;near&mdash;well, I forget the
      name, but he meant near here. When we got out, we had to go through some
      narrow passages between the different streets, and in one of them, which
      was very dark because of the high houses, we met a figure of a man, very
      tall, and wrapped in a long black cloak; it drew back to let us pass, and
      just as I got close to it it turned its head, and I saw the face; it was
      stem and dark, and wore a black beard, but the beautiful eyes were the
      same, and when I saw them I knew it was Mr. Arundel, or,&rdquo; he added,
      sinking his voice, &ldquo;his ghost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As his companion remained silent, he continued, &ldquo;When I saw who it was, I
      stopped, and was just going to speak, but at that moment he stared hard at
      me, gave a violent start, and before I could do anything to prevent it,
      vanished through a dark archway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you must have mistaken some one for him,&rdquo; returned Annie, struggling
      for composure&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Arundel is probably in England, and ghosts are
      out of the question; besides, if there are such things, which I much
      doubt, they only appear after people are dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter considered for a minute, and then met the difficulty by
      consolatorily suggesting, &ldquo;Perhaps dear Mr. Arundel <i>is</i> dead&mdash;perhaps
      he grew so unhappy that he could not live without ever seeing Faust and
      me, and&mdash;ah! Annie, how could you be so cruel as to send him away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I send him away, Walter! what can have put such a strange notion into
      your head?&rdquo; exclaimed Annie, astonished at the accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes you did,&rdquo; returned Walter vehemently; &ldquo;he went away because he loved
      you and you would not love him&mdash;it was very cruel of you, and I hate
      you for it whenever I remember how unkind you have been,&rdquo; and overcome by
      his feelings, the poor boy burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand confused thoughts flashed like lightning across Annie&rsquo;s brain.
      What could he mean?&mdash;was she listening to the mere folly of idiocy,
      or could he indeed have any possible foundation for his assertion? Anxious
      to soothe him, she laid her hand caressingly upon his, while, replying
      rather to her own heart than to his last observation, she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my poor Walter, he whom you so much regret never loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but he did, though,&rdquo; returned Walter positively, drying his tears&mdash;&ldquo;I
      <i>know</i> it.&rdquo; He spoke so decidedly that Annie, despite her reason,
      could not but feel curious to hear more, and turning away her head to hide
      her agitation, she asked in a low voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I tell you, you must never tell the General or anybody,&rdquo; returned
      Walter&mdash;&ldquo;people think I&rsquo;m a fool, and I know I am not clever, and
      can&rsquo;t learn like other boys, and sometimes I feel a weight just here,&rdquo; and
      he pressed his hand to his forehead, &ldquo;and then all my sense goes out&mdash;I
      wonder where it goes to, Annie&mdash;do you think it finds wings and flies
      up to heaven among the white angels? I think so sometimes, and then I long
      to be a bird and fly with it.&rdquo; Too much interested to allow him to fall
      into a new train of thought, Annie recalled his wandering ideas by saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were talking about Mr. Arundel, Walter dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, and about you, I remember,&rdquo; resumed Walter. &ldquo;I knew, at least I
      thought, he was very fond of you a long time ago, but I was not quite sure
      of it till one day when I dressed Faust up like a gentleman, with Mr.
      Arundel&rsquo;s watch, and you took it off the dog&rsquo;s neck, and then you threw
      your arms round him and kissed him as you did just now&mdash;that was what
      made me angry when I remembered about the first time&mdash;well, while you
      were hugging Faust, Mr. Arundel came to the door and saw you, though you
      did not see him, and his eyes danced and sparkled, and his mouth melted
      into such a sweet smile; he was so glad to see how fond you were of Faust,
      and then I knew he loved you, for if he had not, he would not have cared
      about it, you know. Then he went away and left me Faust, and I thought
      because he had left Faust he was sure to come back, but I know now that he
      left him to comfort me, and went away himself all alone. Then that stupid
      Mr.. Spooner came; he&rsquo;s a great friend of Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s, and one day
      they were talking together, and they fancied I did not attend to them, but
      I did though, for I knew they were talking about Mr. Arundel. Well, Mr.
      Spooner asked why he went away, and Lord Bellefield replied, &lsquo;Why, if the
      truth must be told, he had the audacity (what does that mean?) to raise
      his eyes to my cousin Annie.&rsquo; Mr. Spooner questioned him further, and he
      informed him that Mr. Arundel had gone boldly to the General, and said he
      loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told my father so!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so he said,&rdquo; resumed Walter; &ldquo;and the General told him you loved
      Lord Bellefield instead, and meant to be his wife; and then poor Mr.
      Arundel said he would go away, and so he did, but of course if you had
      loved him he would have stayed, and we should all have been so happy
      together. So you see, Annie, it <i>was</i> you that sent him away, and
      since I&rsquo;ve known that I&rsquo;ve hated you, and tried to keep Faust from loving
      you, only he will, and I can&rsquo;t hate you quite always; but I never meant to
      tell you all this, and you must never tell Lord Bellefield, or he would be
      ready to kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, then regarding her with a sad, regretful look, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Annie, is it really true that you don&rsquo;t love dear Mr. Arundel?&rdquo; Poor
      Annie! affected and excited as she had been by the foregoing scene, this
      last speech was too much for her, and throwing her arms about the boy&rsquo;s
      neck, and hiding her burning cheek against his breast, she whispered,
      &ldquo;Dearest Walter, do not hate me! <i>you have no cause to do so!</i>&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LVIII.&mdash;CONTAINS MUCH PLOTTING AND COUNTERPLOTTING.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the evening
      of the Tuesday in Epsom week, the day before the Derby. Lord Bellefield,
      though outwardly calm, was inwardly a prey to the most painful mental
      excitement. His lordship had met with a continued run of ill-fortune
      latterly&mdash;everything he had attempted had turned out badly: if he
      betted on a race, the horse he backed invariably lost; if he played, cards
      and dice equally declared against him; he had lavished hundreds in
      presents to a new opera dancer, and at the moment in which he deemed his
      suit successful she had eloped with a younger, richer, and handsomer man;
      his tradesmen began to mistrust him and to dun him unpleasantly; several
      of his intimates to whom he owed money grew cool and eyed him
      suspiciously; his extravagance had reached his father&rsquo;s ears, and Lord
      Ashford had not only ventured to remonstrate with him, but apparently bent
      on adding insult to injury, had cited the example of his younger brother,
      Charles Leicester (whom from his heart he despised), and held him up as a
      pattern for his imitation, while Lord Bellefield was forced to bear this
      lecturing patiently; for although the estates were entailed, his father
      had been a careful man, and was possessed of a large personalty which he
      could leave to whom he pleased. The only piece of good luck to set against
      all this &ldquo;monstrous quantity&rdquo; of vexation was the admirable promise
      displayed by the Dodona Colt. This exemplary quadruped, now individualised
      by the name of &ldquo;Oracle,&rdquo; appeared to have been born with a metaphorical
      silver spoon in its delicate mouth, for from the moment in which its four
      black legs (suggestive of its future fleetness, for black-legs are
      invariably <i>fast</i>) put their feet into this uncomfortable world
      everything had prospered with it. The breeder was astonished at it, the
      groom who watched over its infancy was delighted with it; Turnbull, the
      trainer, was so impressed by its merits that he never could speak of it
      without a volley of the strongest oaths in his vocabulary, by which
      expletives he was accustomed (transposing a certain poetical dictum) to <i>strengthen</i>
      his praise of anything which was so fortunate as to win his approval; and
      by the united kind regards of all these worthies this favourite of nature
      had grown in public opinion until it now held the proud position of first
      favourite for the Derby. Lord Bellefield was by this time no new hand upon
      the turf; on the contrary, by dint of having been cheated, and associating
      with those who had cheated him, for several years, he had acquired,
      besides a sort of prescriptive diploma to <i>do</i> as he had been <i>done</i>,
      a considerable insight into the mysteries of the training stable as well
      as the betting ring. He was therefore habitually cautious; but in the
      present instance all his acquired knowledge and natural acuteness
      coincided with the opinions of his underlings, to prove to him that in the
      Dodona Colt he had indeed drawn a rare prize; and that if he could but
      ensure that which our sanguine country is popularly supposed to expect&mdash;viz.,
      that &ldquo;every man should do his duty,&rdquo; his horse, and none other, must be
      winner of the Derby. Accordingly, all the powers of his intellect (which,
      although not enlarged, was subtle and acute) were now directed to two
      points&mdash;viz., first, to take all precautions to ensure that his horse
      should be fairly dealt by; and secondly, to make such a book on the event
      as might retrieve his bankrupt fortunes. This last feat he had succeeded
      in accomplishing even beyond his utmost wishes; and accustomed as he was
      to hazard large sums upon the cast of a die, he began to grow alarmed at
      the magnitude of the stake for which he was about to contend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having dined in town at his club, he returned to his luxurious bachelor <i>ménage</i>
      in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Street, and desiring that he might
      not be disturbed, drew out his betting-book, examined it carefully, went
      through the calculations again and again, referred to the latest odds&mdash;and
      then closing it with a sigh, muttered, &ldquo;Yes, they are all safe men, men
      who will pay to the hour, and if Oracle runs true, this cursed load of
      debt will be wiped off, and&mdash;I shall be rich enough to begin afresh
      and contract a new one!&mdash;if! ay, there&rsquo;s the rub&mdash;if!&rdquo; He strode
      up and down the room. &ldquo;I am wretchedly nervous to-night,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      ringing the bell. &ldquo;Bring brandy,&rdquo; he continued as the servant appeared;
      then filling a wine-glass, he drank it off as if it had been water&mdash;&ldquo;leave
      it,&rdquo; he said; then resuming his walk, added, &ldquo;It <i>must</i> go right&mdash;there
      is not a horse that can come near him; Tartuffe was the only one that had
      a chance, and Turnbull swears he is safe to lose; he witnessed the private
      trial himself, and the colt won by a head, carrying 5 lbs. extra weight.
      That amusement cost me £50 to bribe Austerlitz&rsquo;s trainer to allow the
      trial to take place. True, Turnbull may have lied&mdash;and yet why should
      he? he owes everything to me&mdash;though that has nothing to do with it&mdash;gratitude,
      if there be such a quality, is simply prospective&mdash;men are grateful
      to those only from whom they expect favours. Well, even thus, Turnbull is
      bound to me hand and foot; besides, I know he has backed the colt heavily
      himself: barring accidents, then, against which no foresight can provide,
      and of which therefore it is useless to think, I stand safe to win. And
      yet it is a frightful sum to hazard on the uncertainties of a horse-race.
      If I should lose, I must either blow out my brains like poor Mellerton, or
      quit the country, marry Annie Grant, and live abroad on her money till my
      father dies&mdash;and he&rsquo;s as likely to last twenty years longer as I am.
      I scarcely know which alternative is preferable. What an infernal fool
      I&rsquo;ve been to bring myself into this scrape; but when a man has such a run
      of ill-luck against him as I have been cursed with for the last year, what
      is he to do?&rdquo; He paused, stretched himself wearily, and then glancing at a
      gilt clock on the chimney-piece, muttered, &ldquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock; I must be up
      early to-morrow and keep a clear head&mdash;I&rsquo;ll smoke a cigar and turn
      in.&rdquo; At this moment the house-bell rang sharply, and Lord Bellefield
      started like a guilty thing. With an oath at this fresh proof of his
      nervousness, he filled and drank a second glass of brandy, then stood
      listening with a degree of eager anxiety which, despite his efforts, he
      could not restrain. Doors opened and shut, and at length a servant
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Bellefield before the man could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A person wishes particularly to see your lordship,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say I am engaged, and can see no one; I thought I told you I would not be
      disturbed,&rdquo; returned his master angrily; &ldquo;stay,&rdquo; he continued, as a new
      idea struck him, &ldquo;what kind of person is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He desired me to inform your lordship that his name was Turnbull,&rdquo; was
      the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an oath at the man&rsquo;s stupidity, Lord Bellefield desired him to admit
      the visitor instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Turnbull,&rdquo; he exclaimed eagerly as the trainer entered, &ldquo;what is
      it, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, Turnbull, a tall, stout-built fellow, with a clever but
      disagreeable expression of countenance glanced carefully round the room to
      assure himself that they were alone, and then approaching Lord Bellefield,
      began, &ldquo;Why, you see, my lud, I thought I&rsquo;d better lose no time, for there
      ain&rsquo;t too many hours between now and tomorrow&rsquo;s race, so I jumped on to my
      &rsquo;ack, cantered over to the rail, &rsquo;ailed a &rsquo;Ansom&rsquo;s
      cab, and &rsquo;ere I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing amiss, eh? nothing wrong with the colt?&rdquo; asked Lord Bellefield
      with an affectation of indifference, though any one who had watched him
      closely might have seen that he turned very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, bless his eyes, he&rsquo;s as right as a trivet, and as playful and
      impudent as&mdash;as a brick,&rdquo; continued Mr. Turnbull, rather at a loss
      for a sufficiently eulogistic simile; &ldquo;it was only this morning he took up
      little Bill the &rsquo;elper by the waistband of his indispentionables
      and shuk him like a tarrier would a rat. It would have done your ludship&rsquo;s
      &rsquo;art good to have seen him; he&rsquo;ll come out to-morrow as fresh as
      paint, bless his bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, what is it, if Oracle is all right?&rdquo; returned his employer,
      greatly relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, unfortunately there&rsquo;s somebody else as has got a &rsquo;orse as is
      all right too, and I&rsquo;m afraid we ain&rsquo;t quite so sure of the race as we
      fancied we was,&rdquo; was the dispiriting reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought you had satisfied yourself that there was not a horse that
      could run near him. You tell me he beat Tartuffe carrying 5 lbs. extra
      weight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, so I believed; but the sharpest of us is done sometimes. It&rsquo;s a
      wicked cross-bred world to live in, and a man need be wide-awaker than&mdash;than
      one o&rsquo;clock, to be down to all their moves.&rdquo; So saying, the discomfited
      trainer rubbed his nose as if to brighten his wits, and continued, &ldquo;The
      truth is this, my lud&mdash;one of my grooms cum to me this morning, and
      said if I would stand a soveraign between him and one of his mates, he
      would tell me something as I ought to know. Well, seeing as this race is
      rather a peculiar one, and as any little mistake might turn out unpleasant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; interrupted Lord Bellefield, drawing himself up
      with a haughty gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my lud, nothing,&rdquo; returned Turnbull obsequiously, &ldquo;only as our
      colt stands first favourite, and as we&rsquo;ve made our calcilations to win, I
      thought the Californian farthing would not be thrown away. According he
      brought up his mate, as he called him, which was the hidentical boy as
      first rode the colt, and he confessed that him and the boy that rode
      Tartuffe had met one day when they was out a exercising, and just for
      their own amusement they give &rsquo;em a three-mile gallop. They run
      very near together, but Tartuffe beat our colt by above a length; that
      he&rsquo;d seen the trial afterwards, and that he knowed from the difference in
      Tartufife&rsquo;s running that he was not rode fair, or was overweighted, or
      something. Well, my lud, this information bothered me, and made me feel
      suspicious that some move had been tried on which we was not up to, and
      while I was scheming how to cipher it out, the same boy cum again, and
      told me that the lad that rode Tartuffe at the second trial was a keeping
      company along with his sister, and that he thought she might worm
      something out of him if she could be got to try. Accordingly I sent for
      the gal, and between bribing, coaxing, and frightening her, persuaded her
      to undertake the job. She had some trouble with the young feller, but she
      is a sharp, clever gal, and she never left him till she dragged it out of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drew what out of him?&rdquo; interrupted Lord Bellefield, unable to restrain
      his impatience; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you come to the point at once? you&rsquo;ll distract me
      with your prosing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the long and short of it is, as I see your ludship&rsquo;s getting in a
      hurry (and, indeed, there ain&rsquo;t no time to be lost), the long and short of
      it is, that they&rsquo;ve bin and turned the tables upon us: while we put 5 lbs.
      extra weight on our horse, they shoved 8 lbs. on theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Tartuffe ran within a head of the colt carrying 3 lbs. extra,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Lord Bellefield, &ldquo;and of course without that disadvantage would
      again have beaten him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Oracle is a better horse now than he was at the time the trial
      cum off,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but the race ain&rsquo;t the safe thing I thought it.
      It&rsquo;s rather a ticklish chance to trust to, if your ludship&rsquo;s got at all a
      heavy book upon the ewent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he made this uncomfortable acknowledgment the trainer leered
      inquiringly with his cunning little eyes at his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield did not immediately answer; but leaning his elbow on the
      chimney-piece, remained buried in thought, his pale cheeks and the eager
      quivering of his under lip, which from time to time he unconsciously bit
      till the marks of his teeth remained in blood upon it, alone testifying
      the mental suffering he experienced. Ruin and disgrace were before him.
      Nor was this all. The Duc d&rsquo;Austerlitz, a young foreigner who, bitten with
      Anglo-mania, had purchased a racing stud and was the owner of Tartuffe,
      happened to be the individual before alluded to as Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s
      successful rival in the venial affections of the fascinating <i>danseuse</i>.
      He hated him, accordingly, with an intensity which would have secured him
      the approbation of the good-hater-loving Dr. Johnson. If anything,
      therefore, were wanting to render the intelligence he had just received
      doubly irritating to him, this fact supplied the deficiency. His lordship,
      however, possessed one element of greatness&mdash;his spirit invariably
      rose with difficulties, and the greater the emergency the more cool and
      collected did he become. Having remained silent for some minutes, he
      observed quietly, &ldquo;I suppose, Turnbull, you, being a shrewd, clever fellow
      in your way, scarcely came here merely to tell me this. You are perfectly
      aware that, relying upon your information and judgment, I have made a
      heavy book on this race, and can imagine that, however long my purse may
      be, I shall find it more agreeable to win than to lose. You have,
      therefore, I am sure, some expedient to propose. In fact, I read in your
      face that it is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ludship I always knew to have a sharp eye for a good horse or a
      pretty gal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you <i>must</i> be wide awake if you can read a
      man&rsquo;s thoughts in his face. It ain&rsquo;t such an easy matter to say what is
      best to do; if your ludship made rather too heavy a book on the race, I
      should recommend a little careful hedging to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield shook his head. &ldquo;Too late to make anything of it,&rdquo; he
      replied, &ldquo;that is, of course, I might save myself from any very heavy
      loss, but I must have money&mdash;a&mdash;in fact, I stand so fair to win
      largely by this race, that hedging will be quite a <i>dernier ressort</i>.
      But you have some better scheme than that to propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your ludship is at a loss how to act, it is not likely that any plan
      of mine will do the trick,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not Turnbull wished to provoke his employer, certain it is his
      speech produced that effect, for with an oath Lord Bellefield exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you are aiming at? if it be money you are standing out for,
      you have only to prevent Tartuffe from starting, and name your own price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, it might be as well to let him start; men have been
      transported for interfering with a race &rsquo;orse to purwent his
      starting&mdash;but he need not win the Derby for all that,&rdquo; was the
      enigmatical reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s lip curled with a sardonic smile; his knowledge of human
      nature had not then deceived him&mdash;Turnbull had some scheme <i>in
      petto</i>, and was only waiting to secure the best market for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose £1000 will satisfy you?&rdquo; he said; and as the trainer bowed his
      gratitude, continued, &ldquo;You are certain your plan cannot fail? What is it
      you propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, my lud, &rsquo;orses is like &rsquo;uman creeturs in many
      respecs,&rdquo; replied Turnbull sententiously; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some things as agrees
      with their stummicks, and some as disagrees with &rsquo;em; the things
      that agrees with the hanimals makes &rsquo;em run faster, the things that
      disagrees makes them run slower, or if you give it &rsquo;em too strong
      they comes to a standstill all together. Now, if so be as Tartuffe was to
      have a taste of a certain drug as I knows on&mdash;that ain&rsquo;t very
      different from hopium&mdash;give to him afore he goes to sleep to-night,
      he&rsquo;ll come to the starting post all right and run very respectible, but if
      he beats our &rsquo;orse I&rsquo;ll engage to eat him, saddle and all. I can&rsquo;t
      speak fairer than that, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who have you fixed upon to execute this piece of delectable
      rascality?&rdquo; inquired Lord Bellefield, unable to repress a sneer at the
      meanness of the villainy by which, however, he was only too glad to
      profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not a very easy matter to pitch upon the right man,&rdquo; rejoined the
      trainer, &ldquo;but luckily I happened to remember a party that seemed as if
      he&rsquo;d been born a purpose for the job, and who has been so thoroughly
      cleaned out lately that he was not likely to be particular about trifles.
      I saw him before I left home, showed him which way his interest lay, put
      him up to my ideas on the subject, and I hope when I sees your ludship
      to-morrow morning I shall have some good news to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you early, before people are about,&rdquo; returned Lord
      Bellefield; &ldquo;it is important that I should know the result of this scheme
      as soon as possible. The greatest caution must be observed lest the matter
      should transpire, and if anything comes out, you of course must take it
      upon yourself. The man should go abroad for a time. And now I must try and
      get a couple of hours&rsquo; sleep, or my head will not be fit for to-morrow&rsquo;s
      work. I breakfast at Epsom with a set of men, but I&rsquo;ll be with you first.
      You&rsquo;ve acted with your usual zeal and cleverness, Turnbull, and I&rsquo;ll take
      care that you shall have no reason to repent your honesty to your
      employer; only let us win to-morrow&rsquo;s race and your fortune is made.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he rang the bell, and with many servile acknowledgments of his
      master&rsquo;s promised liberality the trainer departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this interview was taking place a far different scene had been
      enacting in the premises occupied by the racing stud of the Due
      d&rsquo;Austerlitz. As the clock over the stables chimed the hour after midnight
      a light ladder was placed against the wall of one of the outer buildings,
      and a slightly-framed, agile man ran up it, and drawing it cautiously
      after him laid it in a place of security, where it would remain unnoticed
      till his return. He then crept with noiseless, catlike steps over roofs
      and along parapets, finding among rain-gutters and coping-stones a
      dangerous and uncertain footing, until he reached a building nearly in the
      centre of the yard; here he paused, and drawing from his pocket a short
      iron instrument, shaped like a chisel at one end, he cautiously chipped
      away the mortar round one of the tiles which protected an angle of the
      roof, and by removing the tile, exposed the ends of a row of slating.
      Quietly raising one of the slates, he, by means of the instrument above
      alluded to, which is known to the initiated by the euphonious title of a
      &ldquo;jemmy,&rdquo; snapped the nails which retained it in its place and removed it.
      Having acted in a similar manner by two others, he produced a small
      cabinetmaker&rsquo;s saw, and cutting through the battens, opened a space
      sufficiently wide to admit the passage of a man&rsquo;s body. Replacing his
      tools, he crept through the aperture thus effected, and letting himself
      down by his hands into the loft beneath, dropped noiselessly on to some
      trusses of hay placed there for future consumption. Part of his task was
      now accomplished, for he was in the loft over the loose-box in which
      Tartuffe was reposing his graceful limbs before the coming struggle; but
      the most difficult and hazardous portion of his enterprise remained yet to
      be accomplished. Crawling on his hands and knees, he reached one of the
      openings by which the hay was let down into the racks beneath, and
      cautiously peeping over, gazed into the interior of the stable itself, and
      noted the precautions taken to secure the safety of the racehorse and the
      difficulties which lay before him. The box in which the animal was placed
      was secured by a strong padlock, the key of which rested at that moment
      under the pillow of Slangsby, the Due d&rsquo;Austerlitz&rsquo;s trainer, while in the
      next box, half-lying, half-sitting on a truss of straw, dozed &ldquo;Yorkshire
      Joe,&rdquo; a broad-shouldered, bowlegged lad some eighteen years of age, who
      had been a kind of equestrian valet to Tartuffe during the whole
      &ldquo;educational course&rdquo; of that promising quadruped.
    </p>
    <p>
      These particulars the intelligent eye of the tenant of the hay-loft took
      in at a glance, while his quick wit decided as rapidly the exact degree in
      which they were calculated to tell for or against the object he sought to
      accomplish. The padlock was in his favour; for as he did not intend to
      enter the horse-box by the door, it would serve to keep Joe out without
      interfering with his design; but the presence of the stable-boy presented
      an insuperable obstacle to his further proceedings. This difficulty had,
      however, been foreseen and provided against. Stealing on tiptoe across the
      loft, he selected a long, stout straw, and thrusting it through the
      key-hole of the door by which the fodder was taken in, he suffered it to
      drop on the outside. Scarcely had he done so, when a low cough announced
      the presence of some confederate, and satisfied that everything was in a
      right train, he noiselessly returned to his post of observation. In
      another moment his quick ear caught the sound of a modest tap at the
      stable-door. Honest Joe&rsquo;s senses not being equally on the alert, the knock
      had to be repeated more than once ere he became aware of it. As soon as he
      grew convinced that the sound was not the creation of his sleeping fancy,
      he rubbed his eyes, stretched himself, and drowsily inquired, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I&mdash;Mary; and I want particularly to speak to you,&rdquo; replied a
      woman&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy want must wait till morning, lass; for I&rsquo;m not a-goaing to leave this
      place to-night for nothink nor nobody; so gang thee whoam agin,&rdquo; was the
      uncourteous reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but Joe, dear Joe, you must hear me to-night; it is something very
      important indeed. You <i>must</i> hear me,&rdquo; pleaded the temptress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I woan&rsquo;t, I tell thee; gangwhoam!&rdquo; returned Joe gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;d thought you&rsquo;d have been so unkind, I would not have stayed
      out of my warm bed, trapesing through Hepsom streets at this time o&rsquo;night,
      which ain&rsquo;t fit for a respecktible young woman to be out in, and coming
      all this way to put you up to something as may lose you your place, and
      worse, if you ain&rsquo;t told of it. I didn&rsquo;t expect sich unkindness&mdash;and
      from you, too; that I didn&rsquo;t;&rdquo; and here a sound akin to a sob, apparently
      indicating that the speaker was weeping, found its way to Joe&rsquo;s ears, and
      going thence straight to his honest, unsuspicious heart, overcame his
      prudence and conquered his resolution. Rising from his seat, he approached
      the door and listened; the sobs still continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, lass, what ails thee?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to anger thee,
      wench! but thee knoas I dare na leave t&rsquo;horse; besoids t&rsquo;stable-dour be
      locked, and maister&rsquo;s got t&rsquo;key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can&rsquo;t you come to the window in the further stable, where we&rsquo;ve
      talked many a time before?&rdquo; suggested the siren. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something about the
      horse I want to tell you, a dodge they&rsquo;re going to try to prevent his
      winning to-morrow. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have come out at this time o&rsquo;night
      for nothing, do you, stupey?&rdquo; This intelligence chased away Joe&rsquo;s last
      lingering scruple, and muttering&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About t&rsquo;horse!&mdash;why did na thee say so afore?&rdquo; he lit a hand-lantern
      at the lamp which hung from the ceiling, and assuring himself by a glance
      that his charge was in safety, quitted the stable by a side-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the occupant of the loft had not been idle. As soon as
      Joe became engrossed by the foregoing conversation, the sound of a fine
      saw at work might have been perceived by a more delicate organisation than
      that of the sturdy groom; and at the moment in which he left the stable
      two of the bars of the rack were silently removed, and through the opening
      thus effected a man cautiously lowered himself, and resting his feet for
      an instant on the manger, dropped lightly into the box occupied by
      Tartuffe.

    <p>
      This feat was accomplished so quietly, that the horse, which happened not
      to be lying down, but was standing, trying, through its muzzle, to nibble
      the straw of its bed, was scarcely startled, merely raising its head and
      staring at its unexpected visitant. This individual now produced from his
      mysterious pocket a handful of oats, and holding them out, allowed
      Tartuffe to smell and nibble at them; while the animal was thus engaged,
      he removed the muzzle, worn for the purpose of preventing it from eating
      its litter, or otherwise gaining access to any food of which the trainer
      might disapprove. His next proceeding was to draw out that ingenious
      instrument of torture yclept a twitch, which, for the benefit of those of
      our lady readers who do not happen to be gifted with &ldquo;a stable mind,&rdquo; or
      to have encouraged sporting tendencies, we may describe as a short, thick
      stick or handle, about two feet long, terminated by a loop of stout
      whipcord or leather, into which the upper-lip, or occasionally the ear of
      the horse, is inserted; then, by twisting the stick, the loop can be
      tightened so as to produce any amount of agony the inflicter may desire:
      the philosophy of the matter being, that the animal finding his struggles
      exactly double his pain, soon has sense enough to choose the lesser of two
      evils, and therefore stands still while nasty things are being forced down
      his throat and other liberties taken with him, which, but for the
      application of the twitch, he would actively resent. In the present
      instance, while the unfortunate Tartuffe was still chewing the oats by
      which his confidence had been betrayed, the twitch was fixed on his nose,
      tightened, and the nauseating ball which was to impair his strength and
      fleetness, and secure the victory to the Dodona Colt, and fortune to Lord
      Bellefield, was already in his mouth ere he was aware that any incivility
      was intended him. To give a horse a ball, however, it is not only
      necessary to put it into its mouth but to thrust it back as far as, if
      possible, the entrance of the gullet, and this operation, even when
      performed in the most skilful manner, is by no means easy to the operator
      or agreeable to the patient. In this last particular the victimised
      Tartuffe appeared to be entirely of our opinion; the blood of his noble
      ancestors stirred within him, and tossing up his head indignantly, he
      became practically aware of the full virtues of the twitch; the pain,
      however, only served to increase his rage, and he attempted to rear; but
      his struggles were vain; his tormentor pertinaciously clung to him, the
      ball was thrust further back in the mouth, and in another moment the
      desired object would have been attained, when suddenly the loop of the
      twitch, unable to bear the strain upon it, snapped. The first use the
      racehorse made of his freedom was to shake his head violently, and at the
      same time opening his mouth, the stupefying ball dropped from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now return to our friend, Yorkshire Joe, who, suspecting no evil,
      was engaged in interesting colloquy with the perfidious Mary; this
      seductive young lady having contrived, with a degree of ingenuity worthy a
      better cause, to prolong the interview by the following expedients. First,
      she assailed her admirer with coquettish reproaches for his unkindness and
      want of gallantry in refusing to speak to her; then she entered into a
      long account of how and when and where she had discovered the pretended
      design against Tartuffe, which she affirmed was to be put into execution
      two hours from that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! What! tie my hands behoind me, shove a gag into my mouth, and then
      and there lame t&rsquo;horse afore my very eyes&mdash;dost thee say, lass? I&rsquo;d
      only like to see the man, or men either, that could do it!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe,
      doubling his fist indignantly; &ldquo;and thee heard this in the tap-room of the
      Chequers, dost thee say?&mdash;What was that noise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I dropped one of my pattens, that was all,&rdquo; returned the girl,
      stooping as if to pick it up, though she was not sorry for an excuse to
      hide her agitation, for her quick ear had detected the sound of a horse&rsquo;s
      hoofs trampling on straw, and she knew that her accomplice was at work.
      &ldquo;Why, you are quite startlish to-night, Joe!&rdquo; she resumed, looking up at
      him with a forced smile; &ldquo;did you think it was a ghost?&mdash;but it&rsquo;s no
      wonder you&rsquo;re nervous; it&rsquo;s hard lines for you, poor fellow, sitting up at
      nights like this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is agen!&rdquo; interrupted Joe; &ldquo;by &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; it&rsquo;s in
      t&rsquo;horsebox,&rdquo; he continued, listening attentively. &ldquo;Them &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      thieves can&rsquo;t be come a&rsquo;ready, sure!&rdquo; And heedless of Mary&rsquo;s assurances
      that it was nothing, and her entreaties to remain only one moment longer,
      the groom, now thoroughly excited, leaped down from the window and rushed
      back into the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the speed of thought the girl sprang to the door at which she had
      previously tapped, and stooping her head to the key-hole, listened
      eagerly. The first thing that met her ear was a volley of abuse from Joe,
      accompanied by heavy blows struck against wood or iron; then a noise as of
      a door being burst open; next, broken curses, dull, muffled strokes,
      ejaculations of rage or pain, the sound of trampling feet, a crushing,
      heavy fall, and then total silence!
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened? She placed her eye to the key-hole, but could see
      nothing. She listened&mdash;but the throbbing of her own heart was the
      only thing she could hear: for the first time the fearful idea occurred to
      her, that by her treacherous dealing she might have occasioned her lover&rsquo;s
      death; and regardless of consequences, she was about to start up and
      summon assistance, when a man&rsquo;s hand was laid on her shoulder, and a gruff
      voice exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is the way my grooms are tampered with! I was sure I heard
      talking going on. Hold up your head, you jade, and let us see what you&rsquo;re
      like; nay, it&rsquo;s no use to struggle, I&rsquo;ve got you fast enough, and see who
      it is I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Mr. Slangsby the trainer drew the girl towards him, and
      forcibly raising her head, threw the light of a bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern full on
      her features. &ldquo;Ha! little Mary Williams,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and what brings
      you here at this time of night, you artful hussy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Slangsby, pray open the door, sir; I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ve
      been and murdered poor Joe,&rdquo; was the reply, and overcome by fear and
      remorse, the girl burst into tears&mdash;real ones, this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They, and who are they, pray? There&rsquo;s some rascality going on here, I
      expect; it&rsquo;s lucky I got up.&rdquo; As he spoke, Slangsby drew a key from his
      pocket, opened the door, and still retaining his grasp on the girl&rsquo;s
      wrist, entered. The first object which met their sight was Joe, by no
      means murdered, although he bore evidences of a severe struggle in a black
      eye and bleeding knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T&rsquo;horse is all right, meister, but I wor only jest in time, though!&rdquo; was
      his opening speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In time for what?&rdquo; inquired Slangsby eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In time to stop yon villain from pizonin the blessed hanimal,&rdquo; returned
      Joe, pointing to something which at first sight appeared to be a large
      bundle, but which proved on examination to be a human being most
      ingeniously tied hand and foot with haybands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the deuce are you, fellow?&rdquo; asked the trainer, addressing the
      individual thus uncomfortably situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t o&rsquo; no use talking to he, for a can&rsquo;t answer with a wisp o&rsquo; straw
      stuffed atween his jaws,&rdquo; observed Joe sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it out then, and untie his legs so that he can stand up and answer
      my questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better shut the dour fust then, meister, for he&rsquo;s a proper slippery
      customer, I can tell you,&rdquo; returned the groom. &ldquo;He promised to gag me and
      tie my hands behind me, I do hear said, but he&rsquo;s found two can play at
      that trick. Get up, ye warmint,&rdquo; he continued, applying a by no means
      gentle kick to the ribs of his prostrate captive, &ldquo;and show your ugly
      mug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person thus upcomplimentarily apostrophised rose slowly and stood
      sullenly awaiting the irainer&rsquo;s scrutiny. The latter, holding the lantern
      so that its light fell upon the stranger&rsquo;s features, recognised him
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beverley,&rdquo; he said in a tone more of contemptuous pity than of anger,
      &ldquo;is it you, sir? I knew times had been getting very bad with you, but I
      did not think you had come to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s lip quivered&mdash;the reproach touched him more than the most
      virulent abuse could have done. His had been, we fear, no very unusual
      fate; at all events he had only fallen one step lower than many who had
      followed the same career as he had done. Well-born, rich, and with above
      average abilities, a taste for gambling and low company had caused him to
      sink lower and lower in the scale of society, till the depth of misery and
      degradation to which he had been reduced, and the extent of the bribe
      offered by Turnbull, had overcome his last feeling of honour or honesty,
      and he had consented to become the agent of another&rsquo;s villainy. Slangsby
      eyed him sternly for a moment, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what you have laid yourself open to, I suppose?&rdquo; The other
      nodded in sign of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be hard upon you, sir,&rdquo; the trainer continued, &ldquo;so if you
      will speak out and tell me <i>all</i>, we may perhaps come to some better
      understanding: what say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other reflected a moment and then replied in a low voice, &ldquo;I will do
      as you wish, but not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, you have distinguished yourself,&rdquo; observed his master, putting his
      hand into his pocket, &ldquo;here is a ten-pound note for you. Do not mention
      this night&rsquo;s work to anybody, and I will take care your wages are raised.
      Now, sir,&rdquo; he continued to Joe&rsquo;s late adversary, &ldquo;I am ready to talk to
      you&mdash;by the way, about the girl; she was your accomplice, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sweetheart has deceived you, Joe,&rdquo; added Slangsby; &ldquo;give her a good
      lecturing, and then lock her up for the night in the saddle-room; she must
      not be at liberty till the race is over, upon any account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honest Joe scratched his head in deep perplexity&mdash;then a light dawned
      upon him, and he perceived how Mary had beguiled him Seizing her roughly
      by the wrist, he dragged her off, exclaiming, &ldquo;Come along, thee cheating
      jade, could&rsquo;st thee foind nothing better to do than to go and deceive a
      poor lad that loved thee, and try to get him into trouble? If thee was but
      a man, I&rsquo;d wollup thee till thou could&rsquo;st not stand, and as it be, a
      little starving will do thee good, so cum along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Slangsby and his companion quitted the stable, and
      adjourning to the trainer&rsquo;s private apartments, held there a long and
      solemn conference; the result may be gathered from the following speeches&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you feel sure Lord Bellefield is aware of the whole thing?&rdquo;
       questioned Slangsby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not a doubt of it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Turnbull was too ready with the
      blunt to be acting on his own account, he has not got the money to do it.
      I am to have £500 clear for this job, and my expenses paid to any part of
      the continent I may select.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we may trust you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course you may, man; by doing as you propose I escape
      transportation, receive £500 to start afresh with, and get sent over to
      Paris out of harm&rsquo;s way free of expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your conscience?&rdquo; inquired Slangsby with a sarcastic smile. &ldquo;Curse
      conscience,&rdquo; was the angry reply; &ldquo;I began life with as much honourable
      feeling as any man, but the villainy of the world has crushed it out of
      me. Life is a struggle, and each one must take care of himself; while I
      had money I spent it liberally, and met my engagements honestly. Now I
      have none, I get it as I can. I undertook to drug your horse because I was
      deeply in debt, all but starving, and Bellefield&rsquo;s bribe offered me a
      chance. I failed through an accident, and fell into your power; your
      proposal regains me the position, and I embrace it now as I did before.
      True, I deceive him: fancying your horse is poisoned he will double his
      bets, which are very heavy already, and be ruined, as better men have been
      before him, but this only serves him right for his rascality, and&mdash;puts
      £500 into my pocket. I have to thank you for your civility, Mr. Slangsby,
      and to wish you good morning.&rdquo; He turned to go, then pausing, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have used me well in this affair, and to show you I am not all bad, I
      will give you a hint. Do not rely too much on the result of that trial:
      Bellefield&rsquo;s colt was only recovering from the strangles then, and has
      since improved in speed and bottom; still Tartuffe can beat him <i>if he
      is made the most of</i>; everything therefore depends upon your jockey; if
      he is careless or over-confident, Oracle may have it yet&mdash;<i>verbum
      sat</i>.&rdquo; So saying, he placed his hat on one side of his head, coolly ran
      his fingers through his hair, and departed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX.&mdash;DESCRIBES THAT INDESCRIBABLE SCENE, &ldquo;THE DERBY DAY.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;F</span>air laughed the
      morn, and soft the zephyr played,&rdquo; as Lord Bellefield, having held an
      interview with his trainer, which had served in great measure to set his
      mind at ease, cantered back to the inn at Epsom, shaved the small portion
      of his chin which he saw fit to denude of hair, made an elaborate toilet
      in the best style of sporting dandyism, and then lounged down to
      breakfast, of which meal he had invited some dozen of his intimates to
      partake. Amongst the last comers was a tall, dark-whiskered man, who might
      be two or three years Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s senior. Pointing to a seat on his
      right hand, his entertainer began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Philips, how is it with you this morning? You&rsquo;ve been wandering
      about as usual, picking up the latest news, I suppose? what say the
      prophets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing original hazarded, my lord,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oracle is as much in favour as ever; Phosphorus is looking up slightly,
      and the Tartuffe party are backing their horse to a high figure; they seem
      to be in earnest, and mean to win if they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, if they can,&rdquo; returned Lord Bellefield, smiling ironically; &ldquo;I
      confess, for my own part, I do not see that animal&rsquo;s good points.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has wonderful power in the loins, and his deep girth gives plenty of
      room for the lungs to play; no fear of &lsquo;bellows to mend&rsquo; in that quarter,&rdquo;
       was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very excellent points in a hunter or steeplechase horse, but misplaced in
      a racer, and by no means calculated to make up for a want of fleetness.
      Tartuffe, in my opinion, has not the true racehorse stride, as Austerlitz
      will find to his cost, if he really is laying money on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may not cover so much ground in his stride as Oracle, but he is
      unusually quick in his gallop, and takes two strokes while another horse
      is taking one. Still black and yellow (Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s colours) will
      give him the go-by, and that is all <i>we</i> have to look to,&rdquo; was the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      In converse such as this, diversified by the interchange of bets of more
      or less magnitude, the breakfast (if a meal consisting of every delicacy
      that could please the palate or pamper the appetite, including meats,
      fish, etc., etc., can be legitimately so called) passed off. When liqueurs
      had been handed round, Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s drag was announced, and the
      company dispersed, first to admire and criticise the turn-out, and then to
      dispose of themselves on and about it. The equipage was in perfect taste,
      and although not so showy as many others on which less care had been
      bestowed, or money expended, yet the drag, with its panels of the darkest
      possible cinnamon brown, picked out with a lighter shade of the same
      colour; the four blood bays, faultless in symmetry; the two outriders on
      horses so exactly matching those in harness, that any one unaccustomed to
      such matters might have been puzzled to conjecture how the grooms could
      distinguish one from another; the harness perfectly free from ornament of
      any kind, save black and yellow rosettes in the horses&rsquo; heads; the two
      grooms in dark, well-fitting, pepper-and-salt liveries, and irreproachable
      top-boots and leathers; the coronet on the doors, the cockades in the
      hats; every trifle down to the gold-mounted whip-handle, excellent of its
      kind, and in harmonious keeping with the whole, presented to the eye of a
      connoisseur a <i>tout ensemble</i> calculated to excite his highest
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seating himself firmly on his box, and controlling his fiery horses with
      an easy confidence which proved him a skilful whip, Lord Belle-field drove
      to the Downs, apparently impassable obstacles seeming to melt before him
      as if by magic (one of the surest tests of a good coachman), and arrived
      on the course exactly at the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; moment. As he drew up to take his
      place by the ropes, a showy britska, drawn by four splendid greys, the
      postilions&rsquo; bright green jackets and velvet caps blazing with gold, dashed
      in before him. The carriage contained two persons&mdash;a singularly
      handsome young man with a foreign cast of features, and a girl with black,
      flashing eyes and a brilliant complexion, dressed not only in, but
      considerably beyond the height of the fashion. These were the Duc
      d&rsquo;Austerlitz and Mademoiselle Angélique, the fascinating<i> danseuse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Bellefield, with curling lip, passed them to take up his station
      farther on, the Frenchman, catching his eye, nodded carelessly, and
      turning to his companion said a few words in a low tone, and they both
      laughed. Had Lord Bellefield been living at a period when the state of
      society allowed the hand to act out the feelings of the heart, he would at
      that moment have sprung upon the Due d&rsquo;Austerlitz, and seizing him by the
      throat, have held on remorselessly till life became extinct. As it was, he
      merely returned the nod by a bow, smiled, kissed the tips of his gloves to
      Angélique, and drove on; so that, after all, civilisation has its
      advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having chosen his station, the bays were unharnessed and led away, and a
      mounted groom approached, leading his master&rsquo;s hack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down to the ring, and then to the Warren, to see them saddle,&rdquo;
       began Lord Bellefield, &ldquo;so I must leave you to take care of yourselves;
      but any one disposed for luncheon will find something to that effect going
      on here after the race. If I am not back, Robson will take good care of
      you.&rdquo; So saying, he gave an order to one of the servants, who remained
      with the drag, then, mounting his horse, cantered away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He carries it off boldly enough, but they say if he loses the race he is
      a ruined man,&rdquo; observed one of the <i>friends</i> he had left behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord Ashford will clear him,&rdquo; remarked another; &ldquo;his grandfather was
      one of the leading counsel of the day, and the old boy feathered his nest
      well before he gave up his wig and gown. He was one of the old school of
      lawyers, and worked in the days when a barrister&rsquo;s professional income was
      a great fact, whereas now it is a great fiction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Briefless, no grumbling; back Oracle for a cool £500, and then you
      may cut chambers till the season&rsquo;s over. But you are wrong about
      Bellefield. Lord Ashford has paid his debts three times, and has taken an
      oath on the family Bible never to do so again; but I don&rsquo;t believe
      Bellefield&rsquo;s anything like hard-up. You know he won £30,000 of poor
      Mellerton before he blew his brains out. Here&rsquo;s Philips can tell us all
      about it; eh, what do you say, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was the cautious reply; &ldquo;and I would not recommend you to let
      Bellefield find out exactly all you&rsquo;ve been mentioning, my dear Chatterby;
      I&rsquo;ve known him shoot a man for less.&rdquo; So saying, Mr. Philips joined in the
      laugh he had raised against the voluble Chatterby, and then swinging
      himself down from the box, left them in order to take his place in the
      betting ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now change the venue to the Warren, a small but picturesque spot
      of ground encircled by a wall, within which enclosure the horses for the
      Derby and Oaks are saddled and mounted. Here jockeys and gentlemen, lords,
      blacklegs, trainers, and pickpockets, mix and jostle with one another
      indiscriminately. Assuredly Epsom, on the Derby day, in exclusive,
      aristocratic England, is the only true Utopia wherein those chimeras of
      French folly, Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality, exist and prosper. Let
      the reader imagine from twenty to five-and-twenty blood-horses, each led
      by its attendant groom and followed by an anxious trainer, while the
      jockey who is to ride it, and on whose skill and courage thousands of
      pounds are depending, carefully inspects the buckling of girths, regulates
      the length of stirrup-leathers, and as far as human foresight will permit,
      provides against any accident which may embarrass him in the coming
      struggle. Then the horse-clothing is removed, and the shining coat and
      carefully-plaited mane of the racehorse are revealed to the eyes of the
      admiring spectators; an attendant satellite at the same moment assists the
      jockey to divest himself of his greatcoat, and he emerges from his
      chrysalis state in all the butterfly splendour of racing dandyism. Then
      the trainer, or the satellite before alluded to, &ldquo;gives him a leg up,&rdquo; and
      with this slight assistance he vaults lightly into the saddle and becomes
      as it were incorporate with the animal he bestrides. Quietly gathering up
      the reins, he presses his cap firmly on his head, slants the point of his
      whip towards the right flank, exchanges a few last words with the trainer,
      and then walks his horse up and down till his competitors are all equally
      prepared. On this occasion the cynosure of every eye was the first
      favourite, Oracle, and when his clothing was removed, and one of the
      cleverest jockeys of the day seated gracefully on his back, he certainly
      did look, to quote the enthusiastic language of his trainer, &ldquo;a reg&rsquo;lur
      pictur,&rdquo; the perfection of a racehorse. Turnbull&rsquo;s last words to the
      jockey were&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save him as much as you safely can till the distance, and if the pace has
      been anything like reasonable, it will be your own fault if the race is
      not your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight contraction of the eyelid proved that the advice was understood
      and appreciated, and man and horse passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it Tartuffe does not show?&rdquo; inquired Lord Bellefield of Turnbull
      in a whisper. &ldquo;The dose can&rsquo;t have been given too strong, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear of that, my lud,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ve probably discovered
      ere this that there is a screw loose somewhere, and they will keep him out
      of sight as long as they can, lest other people should become as wise as
      they are themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the object of his remarks appeared; his rider was already
      mounted, and the horse-clothing removed. Tartuffe was a complete contrast
      to his rival in appearance. The Dodona Colt was a bright bay, with black
      mane, tail, and legs; his head was small, almost to a fault, and shaped
      like that of a deer, his neck longer and more arched than is usually the
      case in thorough-bred horses; while his graceful, slender limbs seemed to
      embody the very ideal of swiftness. Tartuffe was altogether a smaller and
      more compact animal, his colour a rich, dark chestnut, his head larger in
      proportion, and so placed on as to give him the appearance of being
      slightly ewe-necked, his forelegs were shorter, and the arm more muscular
      than those of his graceful rival; but the sloping shoulder, the depth of
      the girth, the breadth and unusual muscular development of the loins and
      haunches, together with a quick, springy step and a general compactness of
      form, afforded to the practised eye evidence of his possessing very
      uncommon powers both of speed and endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks fresh and lively enough,&rdquo; remarked Lord Bellefield, after
      observing the horse narrowly. &ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, my lud,&rdquo; was Turnbull&rsquo;s confident answer; &ldquo;things speaks
      for themselves, the &rsquo;orse ain&rsquo;t allowed to show till the last
      minute, and then he comes out with his jockey ready mounted. Now the logic
      of that dodge lies in a nutshell: finding the hanimal sleepy and out of
      sorts, they keeps him snug till they&rsquo;re forced to purduce him, and then
      shows him with the jockey on him, when a touch with the spur and a pull or
      two at his mouth with a sharp bit makes him look alive again.&rdquo; Approaching
      his lips almost to his employer&rsquo;s ear, he continued, &ldquo;Do you see that
      patch of black grease on his nose? that&rsquo;s where the twitch has cut him.
      Beverley was obliged to twitch him to give him the ball&mdash;so now your
      ludship may bet away without any fear of Tartuffe,&rdquo; and exchanging a
      significant glance, this well-matched pair parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Bellefield, <i>mon cher!</i> how lovely your colt looks this morning&mdash;I
      suppose he is to win; for myself I am preparing to be martyrised with a
      resignation the most touching,&rdquo; and as he spoke Armand Duc d&rsquo;Austerlitz
      stroked his silky moustaches and admired his glossy boot with an air of
      the most innocently graceful self-satisfaction possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really believe that which you say, Monsieur le Duc,&rdquo; replied
      Lord Bellefield; &ldquo;I never saw a horse in better racing condition than
      Tartuffe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! <i>c&rsquo;est un bon petit cheval</i>, and I have betted, ah!&mdash;bah!&mdash;I
      cannot tell you what sums of money upon him, more than half my estates in
      Languedoc; positively I shall have to go through what you call the Bench
      of your Queen, if I lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case it is useless for me to inquire whether you are disposed to
      back Tartuffe against my bay colt,&rdquo; insinuated Lord Bellefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not if you have a fancy that way, <i>mon cher ami</i>,&rdquo; replied
      Armand, smiling to show his white teeth; &ldquo;what shall we say?&mdash;an even
      bet of £3000 shall it be, or £5000?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five is the more comfortable sum of the two,&rdquo; returned Lord Bellefield
      quickly. &ldquo;I always like to bet fives or tens; it simplifies one&rsquo;s book
      amazingly, and I never had a taste for intricate arithmetic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Comme il vous plaira</i>&mdash;say ten, if you like it better.&rdquo; And as
      he spoke Armand drew out a miniature betting-book and a gold pencil-case
      blazing with jewels. Lord Bellefield paused for a moment; certain as he
      believed himself to be of the race, it was a great temptation. But, on the
      other hand, if he appeared too eager, might not suspicion attach to him in
      the event of any clue being gained to the poisoning affair? The idea was
      so alarming to him that prudence overcame avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have unfortunately no estates in Languedoc,&rdquo; he said laughingly; &ldquo;and
      thousands are not so entirely a matter of indifference to me as to your
      Grace; so we will book the bet at five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wager was accordingly so entered; and with friendly smiles and
      courteous words upon their lips these two men parted, one hating the
      successful rival, the other despising the detected swindler! Alas! for the
      shams and deceptions of society! pasteboard and tinsel are more real than
      its hollow-hearted seemings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you see your game,&rdquo; were Slangsby&rsquo;s last words to the jockey who was
      to ride Tartuffe. &ldquo;Make running early in the race, so as to render the
      pace as severe as possible throughout: your horse will live to the end,
      and theirs won&rsquo;t; but if he is not well blown before he gets to the
      distance, it will be a very close thing, and the length of his stride may
      beat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake,&rdquo; was the concise reply; but Slangsby was quite satisfied
      therewith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Racing may be very cruel, and it may lead to gambling and various other
      immoralities, major and minor; and being thus proved contrary to the
      precepts of Christianity, good people may be quite right in using their
      best efforts to discourage it. Nevertheless, it is a manly and exciting
      sport; and although the evils to which we have alluded may (and, we fear,
      do) attend it, we cannot see that the amusement in itself necessitates
      them. On the contrary, we conceive that they are added to it by the
      proneness to evil inherent in human nature, rather than as the natural
      consequence of the sport itself. However this may be, a finer sight than
      the start for the Derby we cannot easily imagine. Let the reader picture
      to himself some twenty three-year-old colts, their proud, expanded
      nostrils snuffing the wind, and their glossy coats glistening in the
      sunshine, ridden by the crack jockeys of England, and therefore of the
      world, drawn up in a line, preparatory to starting; let him reflect, in
      order fully to realise the earnest nature of the scene, that on the fact
      of which may prove the better horse depend many thousands&mdash;perhaps,
      in the aggregate, more than a million of pounds sterling; that the ruin of
      hundreds may be involved in the event of the race; that on the chances of
      that whirlwind course have been expended the anxious thought, the careful
      calculation of days and weeks and months; that the weighing and reducing
      these calculations to a theoretic system, by which some certainty may be
      attained, is the business of many men&rsquo;s lives,&mdash;and he will then have
      some faint idea of the deep, overpowering interest that is excited by
      witnessing the start for the Derby.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the occasion which we are describing two false starts occurred. Twice
      as the word &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; was pronounced by the stentorian lungs of the starter
      did one queer-tempered animal choose pertinaciously to turn its tail where
      its head should have been; and twice did the same &ldquo;voice of power&rdquo;
       vociferate the command &ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; and deep, if not loud, were the
      anathemas breathed by those jockeys who, having manoeuvred themselves into
      a good position, had contrived to &ldquo;get away&rdquo; well. However, &ldquo; &rsquo;tis
      an ill wind which blows good to nobody;&rdquo; and these delays, annoying as
      they were to most of the parties concerned, were as much in favour of the
      supporters of Oracle as they were prejudicial to the interests of those
      who had backed Tartuffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oracle, amongst other gifts of fortune, chanced to be blessed with a most
      amiable and placid temper, while Tartuffe, not possessing so philosophical
      a turn of mind, was apt to get excited in a crowd, and the first false
      start completely unsettling him, he availed himself of the second to bolt
      half-way to Tattenham Corner before his rider could pull him in; and even
      when that feat was accomplished he showed a decided preference for using
      his hind-legs only in progression on his return to the starting-post; by
      his riotous and unmanageable conduct taking a great deal more out of
      himself than was by any means prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, however, they are all in their places&mdash;the word is again
      given, and they are off&mdash;Tartuffe springing away with a bound like
      that of a lion, and half dislocating his rider&rsquo;s arms by a furious effort
      to &ldquo;get his head.&rdquo; As it happened that there were two or three other
      &ldquo;queer&rdquo; tempered horses besides that of the Duc d&rsquo;Austerlitz which
      required careful handling, the pace at first was by no means so &ldquo;good&rdquo; as
      Slangsby had wished it to be; nor could the jockey riding Tartuffe venture
      to improve it, for two reasons: in the first place, his horse was so
      excited that it required all his skill to prevent his running away with
      him; in the second, his former attempt to bolt had sufficed to puff him,
      and he required &ldquo;saving&rdquo; to enable him to regain wind. In the meantime
      Oracle was going sweetly and easily, keeping up with his horses in what
      appeared scarcely beyond a canter. When past the &ldquo;Corner,&rdquo; however,
      Tartuffe had decidedly improved, and his rider, remembering his
      instructions, began to make play. As the pace increased, the &ldquo;first
      flight&rdquo; became considerably more select, the &ldquo;tender-hearted&rdquo; ones
      gradually dropping in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this point Phosphorus had been leading, followed by Advance,
      Whisker, The Lynx, Gossip, and Challenger; but down the next slope
      Tartuffe came up, passed the other horses, and after running neck to neck
      with Phosphorus for about a quarter of a mile, took the lead, and kept it
      by about half a length, Oracle lying well up on the near side. This order
      they preserved till near the distance, when Lynx and Challenger put on the
      steam to dispute the leadership with Tartuffe, who appeared by no means
      disposed to relinquish the post of honour, and the pace grew decidedly
      severe, in spite of which Oracle continued insensibly to creep up to the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the distance Lynx found it &ldquo;no go,&rdquo; and fell back beaten; Gossip taking
      his place, closely waited on by Phosphorus and Oracle; a few strides more,
      in which Oracle improved his position, and then the final struggle begins,
      whips and spurs go to work in earnest&mdash;the pace is actually terrific&mdash;Gossip
      shuts up, Phosphorus is extinguished, Oracle and Tartuffe run neck and
      neck, dust flies, handkerchiefs wave, the spectators shout, when, just at
      the critical moment, the Frenchman&rsquo;s horse shoots forward, as if propelled
      by some invisible power, the favourite is beaten by rather more than a
      head, and Tartuffe remains winner of the Derby.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LX.&mdash;CONTAINS SOME &ldquo;NOVEL&rdquo; REMARKS UPON THE ROMANTIC CEREMONY
      OF MATRIMONY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;F</span>rere, old fellow,
      have you prepared your wedding garments?&rdquo; inquired Bracy, meeting his
      friend accidentally one fine day, about a week after the occurrence of the
      events described in the last chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I hear that your machinations have succeeded,&rdquo; returned Frere
      gruffly, &ldquo;and that De Grandeville is about to marry Lady Lombard. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what it is, Bracy; it strikes me that in assisting people to make
      fools of themselves and each other, you are just wasting your time and
      perverting your talents: depend upon it you may very safely leave folks to
      perform that operation on their own account, they are not likely to class
      that amongst their sins of omission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make fools of themselves!&rdquo; repeated Bracy. &ldquo;My dear Frere, it&rsquo;s nothing
      of the sort, that was an &lsquo;<i>opus operatum</i>,&rsquo; a deed done for our
      friends by beneficent Nature, long before I had the pleasure of their
      acquaintance. Moreover, in the present case, I am seeking to diminish,
      rather than to increase, the standing amount of folly&mdash;man and wife
      are one, you know; <i>ergo</i>, by uniting Lady Lombard and the mighty De
      Grandeville, the ranks of the feeble-minded are one fool <i>minus</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that certainly is an ingenious way of putting it,&rdquo; rejoined Frere,
      laughing in spite of himself; &ldquo;and pray how have you contrived to bring
      about this delectable affair; for I conclude the match <i>is</i> your
      handiwork?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the thing was easy enough to accomplish,&rdquo; replied Bracy. &ldquo;I invented
      pretty speeches, which I declared to each that the other had made about
      them; I exaggerated De Grandeville&rsquo;s position to Lady Lombard, and Lady
      Lombard&rsquo;s wealth to De Grandeville; in short, I lied perseveringly and
      judiciously until I fancied I had got the affair thoroughly <i>en train</i>.
      But I soon found out there was a hitch somewhere; it was clearly not on
      the lady&rsquo;s side, for she was so far gone as to believe in De Grandeville
      to the extent of estimating him at his own valuation, which I take to be
      the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of credulity; so I set steadily to work to
      investigate <i>him</i>, and if possible find out what was the matter. I
      tried various schemes, but none of them would act, his reserve was
      impenetrable; at last, in despair, I gave him a champagne dinner at the
      Polysnobion, taking care to ply him well with wine, and to walk home with
      him afterwards. That did the business&mdash;he must have been most
      transcendently drunk and no mistake, for before we reached his lodgings,
      having confessed to me that his grandfather had been a tallow chandler, he
      went on to relate that the bar to his union with Lady Lombard was his
      inability to discover that she possessed any pedigree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for that matter,&rdquo; interrupted Frere, &ldquo;having admitted the tallow
      chandler, I don&rsquo;t see that he need have been so very particular as to the
      aristocratic tendencies of Lady Lombard&rsquo;s ancestry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Grandeville did not think so,&rdquo; resumed Bracy; &ldquo;he argued that no
      amount of chandlery could infuse vulgarity into the blood of one of his
      illustrious house; external circumstances, he declared, were powerless to
      affect the innate nobility of a De Grandeville: whole years of melting
      days would fail to drop a spot upon that illustrious name. But for a man,
      the founder of whose family came over with the Norman William, to marry a
      woman without a pedigree, one who probably never had so much as a
      grandfather belonging to her, was impossible: he had a warm regard for
      Lady Lombard; he considered that his name and influence, supported by her
      wealth, would place him in one of the proudest positions to which a mortal
      could aspire; but even for this he could not sacrifice his leading
      principle, he could not ally himself to any one without a pedigree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing that he was in earnest, I forbore to laugh at him; and merely
      throwing out hints that I had reason to believe he was in error, and that
      although Lady Lombard&rsquo;s father (an amiable soap-boiler, whose virtues
      simmered for sixty years in the neighbourhood of Shoreditch) had been
      engaged in commerce (he paraphrased the tallow chandler into a Russian
      merchant), as well as his grandfather, still the arguments which applied
      to the one case would hold good in the other, and at all events I begged
      him to take no rash or precipitate step in the matter till I had applied
      to a friend of mine (of course invented for the occasion) who was a
      genealogist, and used my best endeavours to clear up the difficulty&mdash;for
      which disinterested offer he, being still more or less inebriated, blessed
      me reiteratedly and fervently, and so, having seen him safely home, we
      parted. The next morning I visited Lady Lombard, led her on sweetly and
      easily to talk of her family, gained some information, and learned where
      to obtain more, and in less than two days had the satisfaction of proving
      her fiftieth cousin sixteen times removed to Edward the Third. De
      Grandeville was introduced to my friend in the Heralds&rsquo; Office&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom you declared a minute ago to be invented for the occasion,&rdquo;
       interrupted Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which reason he was the more easily personated by Tom Edgehill of the
      Fusileers,&rdquo; resumed the unblushing Bracy. &ldquo;De Grandeville was allowed, as
      a great favour, to peruse the pedigree, believed in it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or pretended to do so,&rdquo; suggested Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the fullest extent!&rdquo; continued Bracy, not heeding the interruption,
      &ldquo;and the next thing I heard was that the parties were engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is actually going to marry a woman without an idea, properly so
      called, in her head, and half as old again as he is, for the sake of her
      money. Well! that&rsquo;s an abyss of degradation I&rsquo;ll never sink to while there
      is a crossing to be swept in London,&rdquo; was Frere&rsquo;s disgusted comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Chacun à son gout</i>&mdash;for my own part I should prefer
      involuntary emigration at the expense and for the good of my country,
      vulgarly denominated transportation, to being married at all, even were
      the opposing party (my hypothetical wife, I mean) the most thorough-bred
      angel that ever wore a bustle,&rdquo; returned Bracy. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;I saw your little friend, Miss Arundel, the other day; she and
      her mother are staying with the &lsquo;Lombardie Character,&rsquo; I find, but of
      course you know all this better than I do. Really that girl writes
      exceedingly good sense for a woman. Now if I were a marrying man, I don&rsquo;t
      know any quarter in which I&rsquo;d sooner throw the handkerchief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might pick it up again for your pains, for she wouldn&rsquo;t have you, I&rsquo;m
      sure,&rdquo; growled Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe so?&rdquo; asked Bracy, with an incredulous smile. &ldquo;Ahem!
      now I flatter myself the little Arundel has better taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better sense than to do any such thing, you mean,&rdquo; returned Frere more
      crossly than before. &ldquo;Depend upon it, whenever Rose Arundel marries, she
      will choose a man who can respect and love her, and not a&mdash;well, I
      don&rsquo;t mean to insult you, my good fellow, but truth will out&mdash;a
      self-conceited young puppy, whose head has been turned by foolish people,
      by whom his cleverness has been overrated and his vanity fostered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bracy drew himself up, and for a minute pretended to look very fierce&mdash;then
      bursting into a hearty laugh, he patted his companion on the back
      affectionately, exclaiming, &ldquo;Poor old Frere! did I put him in a rage?
      never mind, old boy, I only wanted to know whether there was any truth in
      the report that you were engaged to Miss Arundel&mdash;and now let me
      congratulate you. You have no doubt good cause for thinking the young lady
      would have shown her wisdom by selecting a sensible man such as you are,
      rather than a <i>vaurien</i> like myself, even if I were a marrying man
      and had placed such a temptation before her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere looked at him for a moment in utter astonishment, then muttered, &ldquo;A
      vaurien, indeed! I always prophesied that foot-boy of yours would die with
      a rope round his neck, but I begin to think the complaint which will
      necessitate such an operation runs in the family, and that servant and
      master are alike affected by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may be the name of this alarming epidemic which you consider
      likely to terminate so fatally?&rdquo; asked Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most unmitigated and virulent form of chronic impudence,&rdquo; returned
      Frere, laughing; then shaking hands most cordially, these two oddly
      assorted friends parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having left Bracy, Frere bent his steps towards the dwelling of Lady
      Lombard, with whom Mrs. Arundel and Rose were spending a few days for the
      avowed purpose of assisting to prepare her wedding paraphernalia, though
      (as the most skilful dressmaker and the most expensive tradesmen in London
      were at work in the good cause) their duties were merely nominal. Mrs.
      Arundel having explained to her hostess the nature of the engagement
      between Frere and her daughter, that excellent bear was allowed to run
      tame about the house. Lady Lombard, who was at first impressed by a vague
      sense of his awful amount of learning, and decidedly alarmed at his
      snapping and growling, had become reconciled to his presence on perceiving
      that Rose could tame him by a word or a smile, and committing him to her
      care and management, troubled herself no further about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, who do you think has gone to Venice?&rdquo; inquired Frere, after having
      disburdened his pockets of a little library of heavy books, two cold,
      uncomfortable fossils, and the very hard handle of a Roman sword, all
      highly prized and newly acquired treasures, which he had brought that Rose
      might appreciate them and sympathise with him in his delight at having
      obtained them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Venice,&rdquo; returned Rose&mdash;&ldquo;oh! who? do tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, lots of people, it seems,&rdquo; replied Frere. &ldquo;I called upon my uncle,
      Lord Ashford, this morning, and found him in what is vulgarly termed a
      regular stew. Bellefield it seems had a horse which everybody fancied was
      to win the Derby, but what everybody fancied did not come to pass, for the
      said horse was beaten, consequently his owner has lost no end of money,
      for which same I for one do not pity him: I have no sympathy with your
      ruined gamester&mdash;and ruined he is, by the way, horse, foot, and
      artillery, as the military De Grandeville would say. Well, poor uncle
      Ashford showed me a note he had just received from his dutiful first-born,
      telling him that he had not a farthing of ready money in the world, except
      £50 to pay for his journey; that he was quite unable to meet his
      engagements, and that before the settling day for the Derby he must put
      the British Channel between him and those to whom he owed sums so large
      that he neither desired nor expected his father to pay them; that he would
      feel obliged if his lordship would increase his yearly allowance, and that
      he wished letters of credit to be forwarded to him at Venice, to which
      place he proposed immediately to follow General Grant and his daughter,
      who it appears left England only three weeks ago; that it was his
      intention to marry the young lady forthwith, and live abroad upon her
      fortune, until something to his advantage should turn up; and he adds in a
      postscript, that if his father should attempt to prevent his marriage by
      informing General Grant of what he is pleased to call his misfortunes,
      that minute he will blow his brains out. Well, poor uncle, who is a
      high-minded, honourable man, though he is rather proud and cold in his
      manner, could not bear the idea of his son marrying Annie Grant without
      informing the General of his loss of fortune, and at length he resolved to
      meet the difficulty by selling the H&mdash;&mdash;shire estate, and by
      that means increasing Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s allowance till it would amount to
      £3000 a year, in which case General Grant might be informed of the truth
      without the match being broken off, or Bellefield driven to desperation.
      Whereupon I observed innocently enough that the success of the scheme
      would in great measure depend on the tact of the person sent out to manage
      the negotiation: Lord Ashford agreed in this most cordially, and then
      saying how grateful he should feel to any one who would assist him in this
      strait, looked hard at me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you instantly undertook the commission; I know it as well as if I had
      been present and had heard all that passed,&rdquo; interposed Rose with a smile,
      in which, though affection predominated, a slight shade of regret might
      have been traced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, Rose, as I am one of the family, there seemed a kind of
      obligation upon me to do something to help them; and poor uncle Ashford
      did look so pitiful; and really if I had not undertaken it, I don&rsquo;t know
      who could have been found to do so, for Bellefield quarrelled with their
      family solicitor because he refused to allow him to make ducks and drakes
      of some of the entailed property three years ago; and I shall not be gone
      long. Besides, I did not quite forget you, Rosey, for, do you comprehend,
      I shall be able to see Lewis without his fancying that I have been sent
      out expressly to look after him, and perhaps I may be able to persuade him
      to come home and live in England like a reasonable being and a Christian;
      at all events, I shall find out how he is going on there; and I&rsquo;ve another
      thing to talk to Lewis about&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean to remain for ever without
      a wife, Miss Rose&mdash;you need not turn your head away&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      sheer silliness&mdash;you know we <i>are</i> to be married some day, we
      expect matrimony will increase our happiness, and we have sounder grounds
      for our expectations than most of the fools who yoke themselves together
      for life; those who do so, for instance, in order to obtain rank or riches&mdash;our
      next-door neighbours to wit,&rdquo; and he pointed with his thumb in the
      direction of the drawing-room, wherein were seated the mighty De
      Grandeville and his lady-love. &ldquo;As, therefore, my reasoning is good, sound
      reasoning, and matrimony proved to be a desirable thing, why the sooner we
      get the ceremony over the better; so, as I said before, don&rsquo;t turn away
      your head like a little goose, seeing that you&rsquo;re nothing of the kind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Lewis,&rdquo; murmured Rose; &ldquo;he will scarcely rejoice to see you when he
      learns that the object of your mission is to hasten the marriage of Annie
      Grant with Lord Bellefield. Oh, Richard,&rdquo; she continued eagerly, clasping
      her hands, &ldquo;it will make him hate you&mdash;do not go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, I never thought of that,&rdquo; muttered Frere, thoroughly
      perplexed. &ldquo;Why will people go and fall in love with one another that
      didn&rsquo;t ought to?&rdquo; He paused, rubbed his hair back from his forehead till
      it stood on end like the crest of a cockatoo, played with Rose&rsquo;s workbox
      till he overturned it, and in his abstraction committed so many gaucheries
      that his companion was on the point of calling him to order when he
      suddenly returned to his senses, and taking Rose&rsquo;s hand in his, began,
      &ldquo;Now listen to me, my child: in the first place, as this matter nearly
      concerns Lewis, and therefore you, I will do nothing in it of which you do
      not approve; premising this, I will give you my own ideas on the subject.
      Touching Lewis&rsquo;s interest in the affair, the question seems to hinge upon
      this point: does Annie Grant care for him or not? If she does not, it
      can&rsquo;t signify to him who she marries; and as in that case she is probably
      attached to her cousin (women don&rsquo;t <i>always</i> love wisely, you know),
      I should feel able to carry out uncle Ashford&rsquo;s wishes with a clear
      conscience, and trust to Lewis&rsquo;s good sense and kind heart not to incur
      his displeasure by so doing. If, on the other hand, Annie by any chance
      loves him, and has been bullied or persuaded into this engagement, I for
      one will have nothing to do with promoting the match, but, on the
      contrary, will exert myself to the utmost to prevent it; and now what say
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That by doing as you propose you will act rightly, kindly, and
      judiciously, and that come what may of it, your interference must be for
      good,&rdquo; returned Rose, gazing with looks of proud affection upon the
      simple-hearted, high-principled &ldquo;<i>honest</i> man&rdquo; (indeed &ldquo;the noblest
      work of God&rdquo;) who sat beside her. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued after a moment&rsquo;s
      thought, &ldquo;there is one difficulty which I scarcely see how you will get
      over&mdash;how are you to find out whom Annie Grant really loves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her myself,&rdquo; was the straightforward reply. Rose looked at him to see
      if he were joking, but his face was earnest and resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Richard, you will never be able to do that,&rdquo; she remonstrated;
      &ldquo;remember how such a question must distress her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which do you think will distress her most&mdash;to be asked abruptly to
      give her confidence to a person who is anxious to befriend her, or to
      spend her life with one man, when all the time she loves another?&rdquo;
       inquired Frere almost sternly. Then laying his hand on Rose&rsquo;s head and
      stroking her glossy hair, he continued, &ldquo;No! no! Rosey, away with all such
      sophistries; they are the devil&rsquo;s emissaries to render people first
      miserable, and then reckless and wicked. Marriages, properly so termed,
      may be made in Heaven, but depend upon it, the spurious articles too often
      foisted upon the public under that name&mdash;alliances in which this
      world&rsquo;s goods are everything, and the treasures of the next world nothing&mdash;come
      from quite another manufactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a pause, and then Rose inquired when he proposed to set
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there is no good in procrastinating,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;the sooner I
      start the sooner I shall be back again, so to-morrow the lawyer gets the
      necessary papers ready; the next day good Lady Goosecap here is to be
      married, and I mean to attend the ceremony in order to learn how to behave
      on such an occasion; and the day after that, if nothing unforeseen occurs
      to prevent me, I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will write very often&mdash;every&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (Frere raised his
      eyebrows) &ldquo;well then, every other day, will you not?&rdquo; urged Rose
      appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What queer things women are!&rdquo; soliloquised Frere. &ldquo;Now, if you had been
      going to the North Pole,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Rose, &ldquo;it would never
      have occurred to me to <i>ask</i> you to write&mdash;I should have taken
      it for granted that if you had discovered the northwest passage, or done
      anything else worth mentioning, you would have let one know; and why
      people write if they have nothing to say I can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, it is a satisfaction when we are parted from those who are
      dear to us to be assured that they are well,&rdquo; suggested Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing ever ails me,&rdquo; replied Frere, quietly appropriating the
      remark; &ldquo;there is not a doctor in the country who has ever received one
      farthing of my money; and as to physic&mdash;throw physic to the dogs,
      always supposing you to have any such abomination to dispose of, and any
      dogs at hand to throw it to: it&rsquo;s a thing I don&rsquo;t know the taste of, and
      where ignorance is bliss&mdash;well, never mind, I&rsquo;ll write to you all the
      same, if you have a weakness that way, whenever I can find pens, paper,
      and a post-office; only if my letters should happen to be rather prosy,
      somewhat in the much-ado-about-nothing style, small blame to me, that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo; Thus the expedition was agreed upon, and Rose having told Frere some
      hundred things which he was to say to and inquire of Lewis, sat down to
      write a <i>few</i> more &ldquo;notes and queries,&rdquo; winding up with a pathetic
      appeal to her brother to bring his self-imposed exile to a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the silver-footed hours turned round the treadmill of time, till the
      dewy morn appeared which was to witness the celebration of the nuptials of
      Lady Lombard and the mighty Marmaduke De Grande-ville. Oh, the ardour and
      bustle of that devoted household! As for the servants, so late did they
      sit up and so early did they rise, that going to bed at all became rather
      a superstitious observance than a beneficial practice. Then everybody had
      to dress, first themselves and then somebody else; and the amount of white
      muslin concentrated in that happy family rendered space crisp, and gave a
      look of pastoral simplicity to the most iniquitously gorgeous arrangements
      of modern upholstery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride&rsquo;s dress was wonderful&mdash;words are powerless to describe it&mdash;happy
      those women who, favoured beyond all other daughters of Eve, were
      permitted to behold it. One very young lady, rash in her ignorance,
      ventured to ask how much the lace cost a yard. The French artiste,
      Mademoiselle Melanie Amandine Celestine Seraphine Belledentelles, piously
      invoked six authorised female saints, besides the deceased Madame
      Tournour, at whose flounces she had sat to acquire her art, and whom, on
      her lamented removal to Père la Chaise, she had privately canonised for
      her own especial use and behoof, and thus supported did <i>not</i> faint.
      The &ldquo;mistress of the robes,&rdquo; a black-eyed, brown-cheeked grisette, turned
      as pale as her complexion permitted her and sank upon a chair, but being
      unprovided with a smelling-bottle, thought it advisable not to proceed to
      extremities, and the mother of the culprit hurried forward, and with great
      presence of mind led her from the room&mdash;such mysteries are not for
      the profane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then occurred a tremendous episode&mdash;the dress was disposed in
      graceful folds over the ample person of its fortunate possessor, and
      fitted seraphically; only the bottom hook and eye, situated in the region
      round about the waist, would by no means permit themselves to be united,
      and a lucid interval, <i>hiatus valde lachrymabilis</i>, was the fearful
      consequence. The grisette did her very utmost, but her strength was
      inadequate to command the success her zeal deserved, and with flushed
      cheeks and tearful eyes she glanced appealingly to Mademoiselle Melanie
      Amandine, etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ardent foreigner stepped forward to the rescue, all the noble
      self-confidence of her nation flashing in her coal-black eyes, and
      gallantly assumed the post of danger&mdash;she was a small woman, but her
      frame was compact and wiry, and Tydeus-like&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Her little body held a mighty mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting to work with spirit, she devoted all her energies to the task
      before her, aged Lady Lombard winced palpably, unconsciously echoing
      Hamlet&rsquo;s well-known aspiration&mdash;but that good lady&rsquo;s melting moods
      were unfortunately mental, not bodily, and in this attempt &ldquo;to take her
      in&rdquo; even the French dressmaker was foiled; the &ldquo;too solid&rdquo; substance was
      not compressible beyond a certain point, and with a sigh which had a
      marvellous resemblance to the word <i>sacr-r-r-e</i>, Mademoiselle Melanie
      Amandine, etc., etc., desisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah! qu&rsquo;ils sont difficiles ces agraffes!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed, rubbing
      her little hands with a theatrical gesture. &ldquo;I have not to myself force in
      <i>les poignets</i>, vot you call oncles.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrists,&rdquo; mildly suggested Mrs. Arundel, who was assisting to attire the
      bride&mdash;&ldquo;mine are very strong, let me try&rdquo;&mdash;and suiting the
      action to the word, she, Curtius-like, endeavoured to close the yawning
      gulf, but in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah non! c&rsquo;est impossible</i>&mdash;you shall only hurt your hands too
      motch, <i>chère Madame Hirondelle</i>,&rdquo; resumed Mademoiselle&mdash;&ldquo;permit
      me to ring zie bell, we shall make approach <i>le maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i>, vot
      you call zie coachman of zie chambaire, who shall have much of force, <i>et
      ce sera un fait accompli</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Madurmoysel,&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Lombard aghast, as the energetic
      Frenchwoman laid her hand upon the bell-rope&mdash;&ldquo;Stop, if you please, I
      should not like&mdash;that is, it is not exactly the custom to admit the
      male domestics into one&rsquo;s bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the Frenchwoman appeared utterly puzzled as to the reason of
      the objection, then a light broke in upon her, and she began, &ldquo;<i>Ah, je
      comprends!</i> it ees not etiquette; <i>que je suis bête!</i> how I am
      stupide! <i>mais qu&rsquo;ils sont drôles ces petits scandales Anglais! Vraiment
      c&rsquo;est comme la comédie. A Paris nous ne remarquons pas ces petits riens;
      et en Allemagne</i>, zie schneider, vat you call tailor, <i>ils font
      toutes les robes&mdash;mais comment faire donc?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why really, Madurmoysel, <i>je nur par</i>&mdash;I mean, I don&rsquo;t think I
      could bear it, if it was got to,&rdquo; remonstrated Lady Lombard; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
      think the hook and eye might be moved a little? it&rsquo;s unfortunate I am so
      stout&mdash;<i>mais je nur</i>&mdash;can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oh, mille pardons, miladi</i>. Your lady sheep shall not be too stout;
      <i>après la première jeunesse l&rsquo;embonpoint</i> is a great beauty; but zie
      hook and ee, <i>à est dommage; cependant, nous verrons</i>, ve shall see
      vot vill be done.&rdquo; And so saying, Mademoiselle Melanie etc.&lsquo;s nimble
      fingers went to work, and a quarter of an inch was graciously accorded; by
      which means the impossible became possible, and the crisis was safely got
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to breakfast (not <i>the</i> wedding-breakfast, but the breakfast
      before the wedding, two very different matters), that was a regular, or
      rather an irregular scramble: people ate and drank standing, like horses,
      but in a general way feelings were stronger than appetites, and with the
      exception of one middle-aged lady, blessed with a powerful intellect and a
      weak digestion, who having medical authority never to allow herself to
      feel hungry, breakfasted three times that morning with three different
      divisions of the party, little justice was done to the viands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose made herself generally useful, helping all the neglected ones, and
      bringing comforts to the uncomfortable, until she scarcely left herself
      time to dress, and yet appearing the most charming little bridesmaid of
      the lot, although her five companions did not disgrace their uniform of
      white muslin with pink embellishments (the white symbolising their maiden
      innocence, and the pink suggesting the cheerfulness with which they would
      be willing to exchange it for the honourable estate of matrimony).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the carriages came to take up, and Mrs. Arundel and the fair
      Susannah, relict of Col. Brahmin, H.E.I.C.S., had the greatest difficulty
      in sustaining the weak nerves and fluttered spirits of the bride elect,
      who, as she herself expressed it, &ldquo;borne down by two such agitating sets
      of recollections,&rdquo; might well be overcome. However, by the assistance of a
      rich male Lombard relation (whose wealth gilded his vulgarity till Mammon
      worshippers believed this calf a deity) she was safely conveyed to the
      church, where De Grandeville awaited her, accompanied by a splendid old
      ancestor, who might by a very slight stretch of imagination have been
      taken for <i>the</i> identical De Grandeville who had come over with the
      Conqueror, and been carefully preserved (in port wine) ever since. Bracy
      was there, looking preternaturally solemn, all but his eyes, in which, for
      the time being, the whole mischief of his nature appeared concentrated,
      and Frere with him, serving his apprenticeship, as Bracy phrased it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In solemn procession they approached the altar, where the priest awaited
      them, and opening his book, read to them an account of the true nature of
      the ceremony they were about to celebrate&mdash;how it was &ldquo;instituted by
      God in the time of man&rsquo;s innocency,&rdquo; and was symbolical of high and holy
      things, and being ordained to assist us in fulfilling the various duties
      for which we are placed in this world, and on the due performance of which
      will greatly depend our weal or woe for everlasting, it should not be
      undertaken lightly or unadvisedly; then De Grandeville, having learned the
      theory of the matter, proceeded to afford a practical commentary on the
      text by solemnly promising to love and honour Lady Lombard till death them
      should part, while she, in return, pledged herself (with less chance of
      perjury) to serve, obey, and <i>keep</i> him during the term of her
      natural life; then he, Marmaduke, took her, Sarah, from the hands of the
      wealthy Lombard relation, and declared that he did so &ldquo;for richer, for
      poorer,&rdquo; though we much fear, if he had foreseen the smallest probability
      of the realisation of this latter proviso, the ceremony would have been
      then and there interrupted, instead of proceeding as it did, sweetly and
      edifyingly, till it wound up with &ldquo;any amazement.&rdquo; And everybody being
      much pleased and thoroughly satisfied, there was, of course, a great deal
      of crying, though why they cried, unless it was to see so solemn an
      institution thus wantonly profaned, and to hear people use words of prayer
      and praise, and worship God with their lips, while in their hearts they
      were sacrificing all the bitter feelings of their nature before the altar
      of Mammon, we cannot tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the rest Mrs. Arundel wept most meritoriously, until catching
      sight of Bracy sobbing aloud into a very large pocket-handkerchief, her
      weeping became somewhat hysterical, and ended in a sound suspiciously like
      laughter. Then people crowded into the vestry, which was about the size of
      a good four-post bedstead, and names were signed, and fees paid, and small
      jokes made, and then the whole party took coach and returned to the house,
      where <i>the</i> wedding-breakfast awaited them. The humours of a
      wedding-breakfast have been described so often and so well, that we shall
      merely give a very faint outline of the leading idiosyncrasies of the
      affair in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, people were very hungry, Nature having asserted her
      rights and promoted Appetite, <i>vice</i> Feeling sold (or rather starved)
      out. Even the lady with the weak digestion (which made up by increased
      velocity for want of stamina) adding a very substantial fourth to her
      three previous breakfasts. Then, as mouths grew disengaged, tongues found
      room to wag, healths were drunk, and the speechifying began. First uprose
      the De Grandeville ancestor, who was a tall, thin, not to say shadowy old
      gentleman, with a hooked nose and a weak voice, who whispered to the
      company that &ldquo;he rose to&rdquo;&mdash;here his face twitched violently and he
      paused, in evident distress,&mdash;&ldquo;he rose to&rdquo;&mdash;here a tremendous
      sneeze accounted for the previous spasm, and the patient, evidently
      relieved, proceeded, &ldquo;he rose to&rdquo;&mdash;once again he paused, struggling
      furiously with the tails of his coat&mdash;&ldquo;he begged to call the
      attention of the company to&mdash;he had&rdquo;&mdash;still the struggles with
      the coat-tail continued&mdash;&ldquo;he had a toast to propose;&rdquo; here, amidst
      breathless attention, he whispered to his nephew in an aside, audible
      throughout the whole room, &ldquo;Marmaduke, I&rsquo;ve left it in my great-coat&mdash;the
      left-hand pocket, you know;&rdquo; &ldquo;the toast was this&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thank you,
      Jenkins,&rdquo; to the butler, who brought the missing handkerchief on a silver
      waiter, sticky with the overflowings of champagne&mdash;&ldquo;<i>this</i> was
      his toast&mdash;he hoped that the company would do it justice&mdash;Health
      and happiness to the bride and bridegroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the company did it justice; so much so, that if the health and
      happiness of the newly-married pair depended on the amount of champagne
      their friends appeared willing to drink at their expense, sickness and
      sorrow were evils against which they might consider themselves amply
      secured. Silence being restored, the bridegoom rose to return thanks, his
      inborn greatness manifesting itself in every look and gesture, and
      dignified condescension adding a new grace to his sonorous voice and
      grandiloquent delivery. Having glanced round the table with the air of a
      monarch (in a fairy extravaganza) about to address his parliament, he
      cleared his noble throat and began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In rising to&mdash;ar&mdash;return thanks for the honour you have done
      us, in so cordially assenting to the toast proposed by a man whose
      presence might confer a favour upon the most aristocratic assembly in the
      land&mdash;a man whom&mdash;ar&mdash;even at this moment, which I have no
      hesitation&mdash;ar&mdash;in&mdash;ar&rdquo;&mdash;(hear, hear, and question
      from Bracy)&mdash;&ldquo;I repeat, no hesitation in&mdash;in&mdash;no hesitation
      in&mdash;ar&mdash;declaring to be at once the proudest and happiest moment
      of my life&mdash;a man who, even in this season of felicity, I yet
      distinctly&mdash;ar&mdash;yes, distinctly say, I envy; for he has the
      honour to represent the elder branch of that ancient and illustrious house
      of which I am a comparatively insignificant&rdquo; (a groan of indignant denial
      from Bracy, which procured him a gracious smile from the speaker), &ldquo;yes, I&mdash;ar&mdash;repeat
      it, a comparatively insignificant, but I hope not an entirely unworthy
      descendant.&rdquo; Here Bracy, after a slight struggle with Frere, who sought to
      prevent him, rose, and speaking apparently under feelings of the greatest
      excitement, said, &ldquo;He was sorry to interrupt the flow of eloquence which
      was so much delighting the company, but he was certain every one would
      agree with him in saying that Mr. de Grandeville&rsquo;s last observation,
      however creditable it might be to him, as evincing his unparalleled and
      super-Christian (if he might be allowed the term) humility, could not be
      allowed to pass unchallenged. He put it to them collectively, as
      intellectual beings; he put it to them individually, as gallant men and
      lovely women (immense sensation)&mdash;if his noble friend, the
      illustrious man to whose burning eloquence they had just been listening,
      were allowed to set himself forth to the world as &lsquo;comparatively
      insignificant&rsquo; and &lsquo;not entirely unworthy,&rsquo;&mdash;he asked them <i>if</i>
      such terms as these were allowed to be applied to such a character as
      that, <i>where</i> was society to seek its true &lsquo;monarchs of mind&rsquo;? where
      should it look for those heaven-gifted soul-heroes&mdash;those giants of
      thought, those &lsquo;Noblers&rsquo; and &lsquo;that <i>Noblest</i>,&rsquo; to quote the glowing
      words of one of the leading writers of the age, by whom its evils were to
      be remedied, its abuses reformed, and its whole nature purified and
      regenerated?&mdash;he put it to them to declare whether Mr. de Grandeville
      must not be entreated to recall his words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deafening applause followed Bracy&rsquo;s harangue, and the amendment was
      carried <i>nem. con</i>. Thus fooled to the top of his bent, De
      Grandeville resumed his speech, and after making a very absurd display of
      egotistic nonsense, family pride, and personal pretensions, gave the
      health of the company generally, and of his ancient ancestor and the
      vulgar Lombard relation in particular. Then more healths were drunk and
      more speeches made, and a great amount of stupidity elicited, interspersed
      with some drollery, when Bracy was called upon to return thanks for the
      bridesmaids, which he did in an affected falsetto, smiling, blushing,
      coquetting, and screwing up imaginary ringlets, much after the fashion of
      the inimitable John Parry, when it pleases him to enact one of the young
      ladies of England in the nineteenth century. Then the female portion of
      the company retired to relieve their feelings by a little amateur crying
      and kissing, champagne and susceptibility being mysteriously united in the
      tender bosoms of the softer sex; then the miraculous robe was taken off
      and the bride re-attired for travelling; then the gentlemen came upstairs,
      all more or less &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; from drinking wine at that unaccustomed hour
      in the morning, and some little business was transacted; one spirited
      bridesmaid, who had had a shy young man nibbling for some time, actually
      harpooning her fish, and landing him skilfully beyond all chance of
      floundering out of an engagement, by referring him on the spot to mamma.
      Mrs. Arundel, who by this time had learned to entertain a most lady-like
      and unchristian hatred against the fair Susannah, maliciously laid herself
      out to captivate the limp and unstable affections of Mr. Dackerell Dace,
      and succeeded so well, that she actually began to deliberate whether
      opulence and triumph over her rival might not render Dace endurable as a
      permanency. Then the travelling carriage with Newman&rsquo;s four greys drew up
      to the door, and the stereotyped adieus were spoken, the stereotyped
      smiles smiled, and tears shed, and all the necessary nonsense rehearsed
      with most painstaking diligence, the only original feature in the whole
      affair being Frere&rsquo;s remark to Bracy as the happy pair drove off&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were about right, old fellow, when you compared marrying to hanging.
      I tell you what it is&mdash;sooner than undergo all this parade of folly,
      absurdity, and bad taste, I&rsquo;ll be spliced at the pier-head at Dover, and
      set sail for Calais as soon as the ring is on the bride&rsquo;s finger; better
      be sea-sick than sick at heart with such rubbish as we&rsquo;ve been witness
      to.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXI.&mdash;&ldquo;WE MET, &rsquo;TWAS IN A CROWD!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ord Bellefield
      safely accomplished his journey to Venice, reaching that city of palaces
      without let or hindrance. Despite his imperturbable assurance, a close
      observer might have discovered from external signs that his lordship was
      ill at ease, and in no particular was it more apparent than in the marked
      change in his manner towards General Grant and his daughter. The cold
      nonchalance with which he formerly tolerated the General&rsquo;s stateliness,
      and the easy, almost impertinent confidence with which he had been
      accustomed to prosecute his suit to Annie, had given place to an
      affectation of studiously courteous deference when he addressed the
      father, and to respectful yet tender devotion in his intercourse with the
      daughter, which proved that to secure the good opinion of the former, and,
      if possible, the affections of the latter, had now become a matter of
      importance to him. With General Grant he was in great measure successful,
      that gallant officer believing, in his simplicity, that his intended
      son-in-law had at length finished sowing his wild oats; a species of seed
      which, being universally acknowledged to contain, besides every small vice
      extant, the germs of the seven deadly sins, has this remarkable
      peculiarity, that being once sown, it is popularly supposed to bring forth
      a plentiful crop of all the domestic virtues. Deluded by this fallacy, the
      General fondly trusted that the coming event of matrimony had cast its
      shadow before, and extinguished all the wild-fire which had hitherto flung
      its baleful glare over his Lordship&rsquo;s comet-like course; or, to drop
      metaphor and condescend to that much better thing, plain English, the
      gallant officer taught himself to believe that Lord Bellefield had at
      length seen the error of his ways and intended to marry and live
      virtuously ever after. With the lady, however, his lordship did not
      succeed so easily; and skilful tactician as he not unjustly considered
      himself, never had he felt more completely bewildered or more thoroughly
      perplexed how to act. Annie&rsquo;s whole nature appeared to him so completely
      altered that he could hardly recognise her as the same person. Instead of
      the simple, amiable, child-like character which he had despised but
      fancied would do very well for a wife, he now found a proud, capricious
      beauty, whose mood seemed to vary between cold indifference and a teasing,
      sarcastic humour, which he could neither fathom nor control. If he tried
      to interest or amuse her, she listened with a careless, <i>distrait</i>
      manner, which proved his efforts to be completely unavailing; if he
      attempted the tender or sentimental, she laughed at him, turning all he
      said into ridicule by two or three words of quiet but bitter irony. She
      appeared tacitly to acquiesce in their engagement, but any attempt to fix
      a time for its fulfilment served only to estrange her still more. Does the
      reader think this change unnatural? may he never witness the alteration
      which a grief such as Annie&rsquo;s makes, even in the gentlest natures&mdash;may
      he never experience the bitterness of that nascent despair, which can sour
      the sweetest temper and force cold looks and cutting words from eyes
      accustomed to beam with tenderness, and lips from which accents of
      affection alone were wont to flow!
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, rather more than a week after Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s arrival, an
      expedition was proposed to visit one of the architectural lions of the
      picturesque old city, and as the General seemed inclined to accede to the
      scheme, and Annie urged no objection, it was agreed that they should go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make one proviso,&rdquo; observed Charles Leicester, &ldquo;and that is, that you
      come home in good time. I don&rsquo;t wrant to frighten you, in fact there is
      nothing to be frightened about, only I know that there has been for some
      time past a spirit of disaffection abroad among the workmen at the
      Arsenal, and if they should attempt to make a demonstration by
      congregating in the squares and few open spaces in this amphibious city,
      it might be disagreeable for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is such an event at all probable?&rdquo; inquired Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;I had a note this morning from Arundel&rdquo;&mdash;catching
      a reproachful look from his wife, Charley stopped in momentary
      embarrassment, then continued&mdash;&ldquo;a&mdash;that is, from a friend of
      mine, telling me such a thing was possible&mdash;however, I&rsquo;ll go with you
      myself, and keep you in proper order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Charley in his forgetfulness blundered out the name of Arundel, Laura
      did not dare to look at Annie; when, however, she ventured a moment
      afterwards to steal a glance towards her, her features wore the cold,
      listless look which had now, alas! become habitual to them, and exhibited
      no sign of emotion by which her friend could decide whether she had
      remarked the name, or whether it had passed without striking her ear.
      Almost immediately afterwards she rose, and saying she supposed she had
      better get ready, quitted the room. Lord Belle-field had not been present
      at this little scene. With faltering steps Annie sought her own apartment,
      closed and locked the door; then, instead of preparing to dress, flung
      herself into an easy-chair, and pressing her hands upon her throbbing
      temples, tried to collect her thoughts. She had heard the name only too
      clearly, and combining it with Walter&rsquo;s tale of the ghost, had guessed the
      truth. <i>He</i> was then in Venice, and not only that, but he had
      evidently established some communication with the Leicesters, and must
      therefore be aware of the presence of her father and herself; nay, by what
      she had gathered from Charles&rsquo;s speech, he must be actually engaged in
      watching over their safety; and as the idea struck her, a soft, bright
      light came into her eyes, and a faint blush restored the roses to her
      cheeks, so that any one who had seen her five minutes before would
      scarcely have recognised her for the same person. &ldquo;But with what purpose
      could he be there? why, if the Leicesters knew it, had they so studiously
      concealed it from her?&mdash;from <i>her!</i>&rdquo; and as she repeated the
      words the recollection of Walter&rsquo;s speech, &ldquo;He went away because he loved
      you, and you did not love him,&rdquo; flashed across her. &ldquo;What if it were true?
      what if he had really loved her, and had left them because his feelings
      were becoming too strong for his control?&rdquo; and then a thousand remembered
      circumstances (trifling in themselves, but confirmatory of that which she
      now almost believed to be the truth) occurred to her. But if this were
      indeed the case&mdash;if, instead of resigning his situation because, as
      her fears had urged, he had guessed at the nature of her sentiments
      towards him, he had loved her, and his honourable feelings had driven him
      into a self-imposed exile&mdash;what must he not have suffered! and oh!
      knowing as much as he did of her feelings towards Lord Bellefield, what
      must he not have thought of her, when he learned that in less than
      four-and-twenty hours after his departure she had renewed her engagement
      to a man he was aware she both disliked and mistrusted! above all, what a
      false view must it have given him of her feelings towards himself! Oh, how
      she hoped, how she prayed this blow might have been spared him! Then the
      present, what did it mean? the future, how would it turn out? On one point
      she was determined: only let her ascertain beyond a doubt that Lewis loved
      her, and she would die rather than marry Lord Bellefield. The evils that
      befall us in this world are not without even their temporal benefit. Two
      years of hopeless sorrow had given a species of desperate courage to a
      mind naturally prone to a want of self-dependence. <i>Anything</i> was
      preferable to the anguish she had gone through; and Annie Grant&rsquo;s decision
      now was very different to the &ldquo;lady&rsquo;s yea&rdquo; or nay she would have uttered
      ere the storm of passion had swept over her maiden spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect produced on Annie by the new light which had broken in upon her
      did not immediately pass away, and although her remarks were chiefly
      addressed to her cousin Charles, Lord Bellefield was equally surprised and
      puzzled by the change in her manner. In order to reach the building they
      were about to visit, they were forced to disembark from their gondola, and
      after proceeding along a species of cloister, to cross one of the
      foot-bridges which so constantly in Venice intersect the canals. Under the
      shade of an arch of this cloister stood the tall figure of a man; as the
      party approached he drew back further into the shadow, and, himself
      unseen, observed them attentively as they passed. The excitement of the
      morning had left its traces in the flushed cheek and sparkling eye of
      Annie Grant. At the moment she quitted the boat, Charley Leicester had
      made her laugh by some quaint remark on the personal appearance of a fat
      little individual who was one of the gondoliers, but whose figure by no
      means coincided with the romantic associations his avocation recalled. As,
      leaning on Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s arm, she passed the arch behind which the
      stranger was concealed, her companion addressed to her some observation
      which necessitated a reply. Turning to him with the smile Leicester&rsquo;s
      observation had provoked still upon her lips, the light fell strongly on
      her features, revealing them fully to the eager gaze of (for we intend no
      mystification as to his identity) Lewis Arundel. He looked after them with
      straining eyeballs, till a corner of the building hid them from his view.
      Then dark lines spread across his forehead, the proud nostril arched, the
      stern mouth set, the flashing eye grew cold and stony, and a spirit of
      evil seemed to take possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;it has come to this; with my own eyes have I beheld
      her perfidy. It is well that it should be so, the cure will be the more
      complete, and yet&rdquo;&mdash;he pressed his hand to his throbbing brow&mdash;&ldquo;yet
      how beautiful she is! She is changed; her face has acquired expression,
      soul, power, all it wanted to render it perfect, and&mdash;to madden me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, then appearing to have collected strength, continued more
      calmly, &ldquo;Yes, I have seen it; she clung to his arm, she smiled on him, she
      loves and will marry him. It is over; for me there must be no past; I must
      sweep it from my memory. Happiness I can never know; as far as the
      affections are concerned, the game of life is played. Well, be it so, my
      art still is left me, and the dark, the unknown future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he paused. Ere the arrival of the party, the sight of which had so
      deeply affected him, he had been sketching an antique gable opposite. He
      resumed his work, and by a few hasty but graphic strokes transferred to
      his sketch-book the object which had attracted him to the spot. Replacing
      his drawing materials, he continued, &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis strange how the sight
      of that man affected me: I fancied I had taught myself the evil and folly
      of nourishing sentiments of hatred against him, and yet the moment I
      beheld him, all the old feelings rushed back upon me with redoubled
      vigour. I must avoid his presence, or my wise resolutions will go for
      nothing.&rdquo; He sighed deeply. &ldquo;This, then, is all the fruit of two years of
      mental discipline, to find, at the end of the time, that I love her as
      deeply and hate him as bitterly as I did at the beginning. Oh, it is
      humiliating thus to be the slave of passion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Communing with himself after this fashion, Lewis quitted the spot and
      proceeded in the direction of his own lodgings. On reaching the square of
      St. Mark he found it partially occupied by an excited crowd, composed of
      the very lowest order of the people, its numbers being constantly swelled
      by fresh parties pouring in from various parts of the city. It instantly
      occurred to Lewis that in order to reach the Palazzo Grassini, Leicester
      and his companions would be forced to cross the square, and consequently
      obliged to make their way through the crowd; and a feeling which he did
      not attempt to analyse, but which was, in truth, anxiety for Annie&rsquo;s
      safety, determined him to remain there till he had seen them return.
      Accordingly, turning up his coat collar, and slouching his hat over his
      eyes in order to conceal his features, he mingled with the crowd. In the
      meantime the Grant party, ignorant of the difficulties that awaited them,
      were quietly examining statues and criticising pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura, you look tired, and Annie seems as if she were becoming somewhat
      &lsquo;used-up,&rsquo;&rdquo; observed Leicester, glancing from his wife towards his cousin.
      &ldquo;No wonder either, for we&rsquo;ve been on our feet for more than two hours, and
      as for my share in the matter, I tell you plainly, if you keep me here
      much longer, you&rsquo;ll have to carry me home on your back, Mrs. Leicester,
      for walk I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus urged the ladies confessed their fatigue, and their willingness to
      return; but there was still another gallery of paintings unseen, which the
      General evidently wished to visit. He had commissioned an artist to copy
      two or three of them, and he required Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s opinion as to the
      propriety of his choice. This occasioned a difficulty, which Laura met by
      proposing the following scheme&mdash;viz., that she, Annie, and Charley
      should leave the General and Lord Bellefield to their own devices, and
      taking a gondola, row to a point at which they would be within two
      minutes&rsquo; walk of St. Mark&rsquo;s. Lord Bellefield made some slight
      remonstrance, and it was clear he disapproved of the scheme, but the
      General was peremptory, so he had no resource but to submit with the best
      grace he was able.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Famous things gondolas are, to be sure,&rdquo; observed Charley, as, placing a
      cushion beneath his head, he stretched himself at full length under the
      awning; &ldquo;they afford almost the only instance that has come under my
      notice in which the intensely romantic and the very decidedly comfortable
      go hand in hand&mdash;they cut out cabs, and beat &rsquo;busses into
      fits. Now, we only want a little melody to make the thing perfect&mdash;Laura,
      sing us a song!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing you asleep, you mean, you incorrigible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that will do; don&rsquo;t become vituperative, you termagant,&rdquo;
       interrupted her husband. &ldquo;Annie, dear, gentle cousin Annie, warble forth
      something romantic with your angel-voice, do, and I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A regular stunner!&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the epithet be at all appropriate, it clearly proves me
      unqualified for the office,&rdquo; returned Annie, smiling, &ldquo;so you really must
      hold me excused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the long and short of the matter is that the duty devolves upon me,&rdquo;
       rejoined Charley, and slowly raising himself into a half sitting, half
      kneeling attitude, he placed himself at his wife&rsquo;s feet, after the fashion
      of those very interesting cavaliers who do the romantic on the covers of
      sentimental songs; then having played an inaudible prelude upon a
      supposititious guitar, he placed one hand upon his heart, and extending
      the other in a theatrical attitude towards the boatman, begun&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      &ldquo;Gondolier, row&mdash;O!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      when, having extemporarily parodied the first verse of that popular
      melody, he was beginning the second with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this here go&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Glorious&mdash;oh&mdash;o-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      when the prow of the gondola struck against the steps where they were to
      land with so sharp a jerk as to pitch the singer on his hands and knees,
      and effectually check his vocalising. After discharging the boatman, they
      proceeded a short distance along the bank of the canal, and then turned
      down a narrow lane, or alley, leading to the square of St. Mark. In this
      Leicester was annoyed to perceive knots of disreputable-looking men
      talking rapidly, or hurrying along with eager gestures towards the square.
      Finding, as they advanced, that the crowd became thicker, Leicester
      paused, irresolute whether or not to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely we had better turn back,&rdquo; urged Laura. &ldquo;I should not be afraid if
      we were alone, for I know you could take care of me, but&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;
       and she glanced towards Annie, who, although she said nothing, had turned
      very pale, and clung with convulsive energy to her cousin&rsquo;s arm. Charles
      looked back, and to his utter dismay perceived that the crowd behind had
      been increased by a fresh accession of numbers, and that their retreat was
      effectually cut off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing remaining for us but to keep on,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the stream
      of people appears, fortunately, to be going our way, and all we can do is
      to go with it: I dare say they are too much engrossed by their own affairs
      to trouble their heads about us. Whatever occurs, don&rsquo;t let go my arm,
      either of you; it is rather disagreeable, certainly, but there is nothing
      to be really afraid of, and we shall reach home in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hoping these assertions, in regard to the truth of which he was himself
      somewhat sceptical, might suffice to reassure his companions, Leicester
      continued his course, occasionally annoyed by the pressure of the crowd,
      but not otherwise molested till they reached the square of Saint Mark.
      Here the sight that awaited them was by no means encouraging: the whole
      space was filled with a dense crowd of the lowest rabble of Venice, who,
      many of them the worse for liquor, appeared in a state of considerable
      excitement, and filled the air with mingled shouts, cries, and curses. To
      pass safely through such an assembly, with his attention divided between
      his two charges, appeared next to impossible, and thoroughly perplexed,
      Charles Leicester paused, unable to decide whether it were better to
      advance or attempt to retrace their steps. As he thus pondered a rush of
      people forced them forward, and they found themselves completely hemmed in
      by the crowd, while from the pressure of those around them Laura and Annie
      experienced the greatest difficulty in retaining their grasp of Charley&rsquo;s
      arm. Still no personal incivility was offered them, and Leicester began to
      hope they might gradually make their way across the square without actual
      danger, when a cry from Annie convinced him of his error. The cause of her
      alarm was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of that industrious fraternity (some members of which are to be met
      with in every large city) whose principles in regard to the rights of
      property are reprehensibly lax, attracted by the sparkling of a valuable
      brooch in Annie&rsquo;s shawl, conceived the opportunity too good to be lost;
      accordingly, pressing close to her, he made a snatch at the ornament,
      seizing it so rudely as to tear open the shawl and partially drag it from
      her shoulders. As, alarmed by her cry, Charles turned to discover its
      cause, a tall figure sprang forward and wrested his spoil from the robber,
      flinging him off at the same time with such force that he staggered and
      fell; then addressing Leicester, the stranger said in a deep, stern voice,
      each accent of which thrilled through Annie&rsquo;s very soul&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make for the church steps&mdash;think only of protecting Mrs. Leicester.
      I will be answerable for this lady&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Annie was conscious that her shawl was replaced and carefully wrapped
      round her, and she felt herself half-led, half-carried forward by one
      before whose resistless strength all obstacles seemed, as it were, to melt
      away. How they passed through that yelling, maddened crowd she never knew,
      but ere she had well recovered from her first alarm at the ruffian&rsquo;s
      attack, she found herself placed on the steps of St. Mark&rsquo;s Church, her
      back leaning against a column, and the tall, dark figure of her preserver
      standing statue-like beside her, in such a position as to screen her from
      the pressure of the crowd. Involuntarily she glanced up at his features;
      hidden by the coat collar and slouched hat, the only portion of his face
      that remained visible was the tip of a black moustache, the proud, arched
      nostril, and the cold, stony gaze of two fierce black eyes, fixed upon her
      as though they would pierce her very soul. It was a look to haunt her to
      her dying day, and worse than all, <i>she understood it!</i> In a moment
      the idea flashed upon her. He <i>had</i> loved her! he knew she was about
      to marry his bitterest enemy, and now he <i>hated</i> her. Poor Annie, if
      mental agony could kill, that instant she had died. Lewis, thou art
      bitterly avenged!

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;W</span>hat is the next
      move?&rdquo; inquired Leicester, coming up with his arm round his wife&rsquo;s waist,
      and his hat crushed into the shape of a biffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here for a few minutes,&rdquo; returned Lewis, &ldquo;the crowd is already
      dispersing in the direction of the Arsenal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Arsenal, what do they want there?&rdquo; inquired Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To waylay Marinovitch as he leaves the place, and murder him,&rdquo; returned
      Lewis in a stern whisper, &ldquo;but he has been warned of their design, and
      will of course take measures to ensure his safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant all this!&rdquo; muttered Leicester, taking off his injured hat and
      endeavouring in some degree to restore its original shape; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a case
      of wanton destruction&mdash;glad it is not my head all the same. Now the
      coast seems pretty clear, suppose we move on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coldly and silently Lewis resumed his office of guardian: the space
      intervening between St. Mark&rsquo;s Church and the Palazzo Grassini was passed
      in safety, and they stood within the courtyard of Leicester&rsquo;s dwelling.
      Charley laid his hand on Lewis&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come in?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you are hot and tired, and require
      refreshment&mdash;a glass of wine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; he replied coldly; then adding, &ldquo;I am happy to have
      been of use to&mdash;to Mrs. Leicester and yourself,&rdquo; he raised his hat
      slightly to Annie and turned to depart: recollecting however that he still
      held in his hand the brooch which he had rescued from the ruffian&rsquo;s
      clutches, he paused with the intention of giving it to Laura; but Laura
      had caught sight of &ldquo;Tarley&rsquo;s&rdquo; curly head peeping out at her, and actuated
      by a sudden impulse of maternal affection, or for some other reason which
      we shall not attempt to fathom, she had tripped off in the direction of
      her self-willed offspring. Leicester was slowly following her, all his
      faculties apparently engrossed by a second attempt to reform his outraged
      hat. Lewis and Annie were left therefore virtually alone. Advancing
      towards her with an expression of countenance so cold and immovable that
      every feature might have been carved in marble, Lewis began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, I had forgotten to return your brooch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that morning he had personally addressed her, and
      his doing so appeared to break the spell which had kept her silent; she
      took the brooch from him, murmuring some indistinct words of thanks, then
      gaining courage as she proceeded, she glanced at him appealingly, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange as this meeting is, I am sure I cannot be mistaken&mdash;Mr.
      Arundel, have you quite forgotten me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she uttered these words a kind of spasm passed across Lewis&rsquo;s face, and
      for a moment he appeared afraid to trust himself to speak; recovering,
      however, he replied in the same cold, measured tone which he had used
      throughout the adventure&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Grant, <i>I</i> (and he laid an emphasis on the pronoun, so
      light that a casual observer would not have detected it, and yet which
      shot a pang through Annie&rsquo;s heart that caused her colour to come and go,
      and her limbs to tremble) do not forget so quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unable to meet his glance, which she felt was fixed upon her, and scarcely
      conscious, in her agitation, of what she was saying, Annie faltered out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will give my father an opportunity of thanking you, I hope; he will,
      I cannot doubt&mdash;that is, we shall all be glad to renew our intimacy
      with so old a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis paused ere he could trust himself to reply. Her evident emotion, the
      earnestness of her manner, half timid, half imploring, tended to soothe
      his wounded spirit and disarm his wrath; but the vision of the morning, in
      which he had seen her clinging to Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s arm and smiling upon
      him, was too fresh in his recollection, and the demon of pride and
      jealousy still retained full dominion over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must pardon me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will reserve my visit to General Grant
      till I can congratulate him on his daughter&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo; Then raising his
      hat ceremoniously, he bowed to her, and was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      No traces of the tumultuous assembly, which had so greatly alarmed Laura
      and Annie, remained when Lord Bellefield and General Grant crossed the
      square of St. Mark on their return from the morning&rsquo;s sight-seeing. As
      they drew near the Palazzo Grassini, a tall lad in squalid raiment,
      leaning upon crutches, and with a patch over one eye, approached and
      begged of them. The General at first refused to listen to him, but
      becoming wearied by his pertinacity, felt in his pocket for something to
      give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no small change about me,&rdquo; he remarked, after a minute&rsquo;s
      ineffectual search, &ldquo;but you have, Bellefield; they gave you a handful of
      their stupid little coins at the last shop we went into. Lend me two or
      three, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he mentioned his companion&rsquo;s name the beggar fixed his piercing eye on
      the features of the person addressed, scanning them eagerly, as though he
      sought to fix them indelibly in his memory. Returning his glance with a
      haughty stare, his lordship carelessly flung him a couple of <i>Zwanzigers</i>
      and passed on. The beggar watched his retreating figure till it was no
      longer visible, then turning quickly, hobbled with his crutches out of the
      square, continuing the same method of progression till he reached the
      nearest canal, when, looking round to assure himself that he was not
      observed, he coolly pitched his supporters into the water, removed the
      patch from his eye, which by no means seemed to require such a protection,
      walked briskly till he reached a spot where a small skiff was moored,
      springing into which he commenced rowing vigorously, and was soon hidden
      from sight by a bend of the canal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lewis returned to his lodgings the following note awaited him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My search is ended; I have found my sister in time to see her&mdash;die!
      Her seducer, heartless in his villainy, brought his victim to a foreign
      land, kept her in luxury till his fancy wearied of her, and then left her&mdash;to
      starve. My curse has little power, or it would have withered him long ago;
      but may the curse of that God who made him and her cleave to him until&mdash;
      <i>I</i>meet him. Sir, I know not how to thank you. She has told me how
      you warned her, how you explained to her his real character. She was
      infatuated, but it is not for me to judge her. We seem a doomed race,
      fatal alike to ourselves, to those we love, and <i>to those we hate</i>.
      Oh, that she could live! she is soft and gentle, and&mdash;ay! though a
      scoundrel has debased her, still I say it&mdash;she is good and pure, and
      she would have calmed my angry spirit; she would have taught me to love
      something human. But it was not to be: each hour that I sit by her I
      expect to be her last. She sends you her blessing; may God&rsquo;s go with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis could not peruse this letter without deep emotion. In the just,
      though, alas! ill-governed indignation which gave a rude eloquence even to
      the expression of this poor youth&rsquo;s outraged feeling, he traced a likeness
      to his former self. &ldquo;Heartless in his villainy, he kept her in luxury till
      his fancy wearied of her, and then left her&mdash;to starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the man Annie Grant loved and was about to marry! Oh, how his
      heart bled for her! He pictured to himself her future life&mdash;how she
      would gradually, by slow and painful steps, discover her husband&rsquo;s true
      character, each advance in knowledge a new and separate misfortune, until
      love should become indifference, and indifference end in hatred. Even yet
      he might prevent it. His London agent had forwarded to him that morning an
      English newspaper containing an unmistakable allusion to the events of the
      Derby day, and openly declaring Lord Bellefield a defaulter. This shown to
      General Grant, and his tale of Hardy&rsquo;s daughter verified by the evidence
      now in his possession, the old soldier would sooner see his daughter lying
      dead at his feet than sanction her union with a man devoid alike of honour
      and of principle. But then came in pride. Had he known that Annie loved
      him, or had General Grant never mistrusted him, Lewis would have come
      forward without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation; but his motives had been once
      doubted, his affections betrayed, and his pride could neither forget nor
      forgive it. Besides, Lord Bellefield would attribute his interference to a
      feeling of petty malice; such was not the revenge for which, despite his
      principles and his reason, his soul still thirsted. So pride gained the
      day, though, tyrant-like, in the very midst of his triumph he made his
      victim miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to apply his mind to anything, he strolled out, trusting the
      evening air would allay the fever of his blood. After wandering about
      restlessly for some time he remembered that he had eaten nothing for many
      hours, and turning into the nearest casino he called for wine and
      biscuits. Having finished his frugal repast, he was about to leave the
      house when three persons entered, and crossing through the
      refreshment-room, passed into a salon which he knew to be devoted to play.
      One of the three, a short, insignificant-looking man, was a stranger to
      him, but the two others he recognised instantly&mdash;they were Walter and
      Lord Bellefield. A sudden impulse prompted him to follow them; at that
      time in the evening the salon was certain to be pretty well filled, and
      Lewis trusted to avoid observation by mixing with the crowd, relying on
      the alteration in his appearance to escape recognition, even if he were
      perceived either by Walter or Lord Bellefield. Accordingly, waiting his
      opportunity, he joined a group of Italians, who, eagerly talking over the
      attempt upon the life of Colonel Marinovitch (which had been frustrated by
      his escaping on board the corvette which guarded the harbour), scarcely
      perceived this addition to their party. Entering with them, and still
      keeping in the background, he took up a position whence he could observe
      the proceedings of those for both of whom he felt an interest equally
      deep, though so utterly distinct in character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield, who appeared unusually listless and indifferent, lounged
      up to the table and staked a few Napoleons on the chances of the game;
      then, drawing forward a chair he seated himself, and continued carelessly
      to watch the proceedings of the other players. But despite the presence of
      the man he hated, Lewis&rsquo;s attention soon became wholly absorbed in
      observing Walter. From his entire conduct it was evident that this was by
      no means his first visit to the salon; on the contrary, it was only too
      plain that a taste for gambling had been implanted in the poor boy&rsquo;s
      feeble yet obstinate mind. That he clearly understood the nature of the
      game Lewis could not believe, but that he had acquired sufficient insight
      into the rules to enable him to adhere to them, and that he was keenly
      alive to the results of the deal, or the throw, elated when he won and
      depressed when he lost, was most certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third person of the party, whom Lewis rightly conjectured to be his
      successor in the office of tutor, did not play himself, but appeared to
      take great interest in Walter&rsquo;s game, looking over his cards and advising
      him what to do. Lewis also noticed that whenever Walter won he always
      received gold, but that his losses were paid in paper money, and the truth
      immediately occurred to him&mdash;viz., that, child-like, the poor boy
      only attached value to the glittering coin, and that the worth of the
      bank-notes had been completely misrepresented to him, so that he believed
      himself winning when in fact he was losing considerable sums. Moreover,
      from certain glances which passed between Mr. Spooner and the proprietor
      of the salon, who held the bank, Lewis became convinced that some secret
      understanding existed by which the tutor shared in the profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Lord Bellefield was entirely ignorant of all that was passing before
      his eyes Lewis could not conceive, while at the same time the trifling
      nature of the stakes rendered it most unlikely that he could have any
      personal interest in the affair; the probability therefore was that he saw
      what was going on but felt totally indifferent as to the matter. This view
      was confirmed when, as Walter grew more excited, began playing higher, and
      at last staked ten Napoleons upon one cast, Mr. Spooner approached Lord
      Bellefield and whispered something in his ear, to which his friend replied
      carelessly, &ldquo;Oh, let him have his fling while he&rsquo;s in the humour;&rdquo; then in
      a lower tone he added, &ldquo;<i>not blind!</i> but the money is, I dare say, of
      more use in your pocket than in his, so you&rsquo;ll be the greater fool of the
      two if you attempt to prevent him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spooner appeared again to urge some difficulty, to which Lord Bellefield
      rejoined with a sneering laugh, &ldquo;Yes, it suits <i>you</i> charmingly to
      assume the <i>rôle</i> of the innocent! Can&rsquo;t you get him to sign another
      bond payable when he comes of age? Tortoni will no more refuse to cash it
      than he did on a former occasion;&rdquo; then smiling again, he added, &ldquo;I tell
      you I am not blind, <i>mon ami</i>, but &rsquo;tis no concern of mine; I
      am not the lout&rsquo;s guardian, Heaven be thanked.&rdquo; Although from the position
      in which he stood Lewis only caught a word or two here and there of this
      conversation, yet his quick apprehension supplied the blanks with
      sufficient correctness, and the whole villainy of the thing burst upon
      him. Here was a man engaged to educate and watch over the poor,
      feeble-minded being before him abusing the power thus entrusted to him to
      lead him to evil, and availing himself of the imbecility he was bound to
      protect to swindle his helpless charge; while Lord Bellefield, whose duty
      it was to denounce such practices to General Grant the instant he
      suspected them, had evidently not only no intention of doing so, but sat
      coolly looking on, smiling with a fiend-like satisfaction at each fresh
      development of human wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lewis watched Walter&rsquo;s flushed cheeks, eager eyes, and hands which
      trembled as they were stretched out to receive the gold which this time he
      had been allowed to win; as he marked the lines which excitement and the
      permitted indulgence of a capricious, obstinate temper had traced upon his
      smooth brow and round the corners of his mouth, all his old affection for
      the poor boy rushed back upon him, and his just anger grew to such a pitch
      that he could scarcely repress it. At this moment a fresh deal had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will win more,&rdquo; exclaimed Walter eagerly; &ldquo;Mr. Spooner, tell him I want
      to double my stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that has been done already,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;the dealer has doubled
      every one&rsquo;s stake this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will double that,&rdquo; returned Walter, carried away by the excitement
      of the game; &ldquo;tell him so, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spooner appeared for a moment undecided; the stake, thus quadrupled,
      amounted to forty Napoleons, and alarmed at its magnitude, he glanced in
      irresolution towards Lord Bellefield. A look of undisguised contempt for
      his pusillanimity was the only reply his lordship vouchsafed; goaded on by
      which, Spooner turned to comply with his pupil&rsquo;s direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lewis could bear it no longer; regardless of consequences, he strode
      across the room and laid his hand upon Walter&rsquo;s shoulder, saying as he did
      so, in a gentle though determined voice, &ldquo;Walter, you must not play for
      such high stakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a cry of mingled joy and surprise Walter sprang from his seat, gazed
      earnestly at Lewis&rsquo;s features, then exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh, you have come back at
      last!&rdquo; threw himself upon his friend&rsquo;s breast with a burst of tears. Much
      affected, Lewis returned his embrace, and leading him carefully to a seat,
      waited till he should recover from his surprise and emotion. In the
      meantime the game had come to a standstill, the bystanders, consisting
      chiefly of foreigners, being as much charmed by such a scene as an
      Englishman would have been annoyed at it. The moment quiet was in some
      degree restored, the proprietor, mindful of his own interest, resumed his
      deal, inquiring with a glance at Spooner what sum his young friend had
      staked. Spooner paused, but Lord Bellefield, who had risen and with
      lowering brow approached the scene of action, prompted him, and he
      replied, &ldquo;Forty Napoleons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s eye flashed. &ldquo;It is at your peril you do this,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my first
      act on quitting this place shall be to inform General Grant of the manner
      in which you betray the trust he has reposed in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spooner turned pale; but relying on Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s support, managed to
      stammer out, &ldquo;And pray, sir, who the deuce may you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, and this worshipful company also,&rdquo; exclaimed Lord
      Bellefield, stepping forward. &ldquo;This fellow is, or rather was, a menial in
      General Grant&rsquo;s household, discarded for insolent behaviour, and as such
      unfit for the society of gentlemen, into which as he has now ventured to
      intrude himself, I, for one, vote he be ignominiously expelled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech caused, as might be expected, a sensation throughout the room,
      and the bystanders congregated round Lewis and Lord Bellefield, glancing
      from one to the other, to discover from their bearing and appearance which
      was the true man, and which the false. Up to this moment Lewis had been
      wrapped in a large Spanish cloak; he now allowed it to glide from his
      shoulders, as, advancing a step, he boldly confronted his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lordship has been pleased to speak explicitly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;were I
      inclined to follow your example, I might, with some shadow of truth,
      denounce you as a ruined blackleg and an outlawed defaulter; but I prefer
      simply declaring that in the statement you have just made you have
      maliciously and unequivocally&mdash;<i>lied!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he raised his head proudly, and folding his arms across his
      breast, waited the effect of his words. He was not kept long in suspense.
      However numerous might be Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s faults, a want of personal
      courage was not one of them. As Lewis referred to the cause of his
      ignominious exile his face grew pale with rage, but when he gave him the
      lie his fury became uncontrollable. Springing forward with a leap like
      that of a maddened tiger, he struck Lewis a violent blow on the cheek,
      which, firmly as his feet were planted, staggered him, exclaiming as he
      did so&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that, beggar!&rdquo; Instead of rushing on his adversary, as those amongst
      the spectators who knew him (and there were several who did so) expected,
      Lewis, recovering himself, stood for an instant regarding Lord Bellefield
      with a smile of triumph, though to those who remarked him closely there
      was an expression in his eyes which, in spite of themselves, caused them
      to shudder, while, strange to say, he was drawing a soiled <i>white kid
      glove</i> on his right hand; having done so, he advanced a step, saying in
      a stern, deep voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Lordship is too generous&mdash;the beggar returns your almsgiving&mdash;thus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke there was a sudden movement in the crowd&mdash;a frightful
      blow was struck, and Lord Bellefield lay insensible on the ground, the
      blood flowing from a cut on his forehead, whilst over him stood Lewis, his
      mouth set, and his eyes burning with the fire of hatred. Several of the
      bystanders sprang forward to assist the fallen man, but Lewis sternly
      motioned them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;his voice sounded deep and hollow, and there was
      something in the expression of his face which quelled the stoutest heart
      amongst those who stood around him,&mdash;drawing the glove from the hand
      which had struck the blow, he dipped it in the blood that still trickled
      from the forehead of the fallen man, muttering to himself as he did so, &ldquo;<i>That</i>,
      then, has come to pass&mdash;is <i>the rest</i> to follow?&rdquo; He next
      examined the countenance of his prostrate foe&mdash;&ldquo;He is merely
      stunned,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;raise him, and bring water to bathe his temples.&rdquo; As
      he spoke he assisted those who stepped forward to lift the injured man and
      place him on a chair; having done so, he left him to the care of the
      bystanders, and again folding his arms, stood coolly awaiting the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event justified his predictions: on the first application of the cold
      water Lord Bellefield revived, and in less time than could have been
      expected, the bleeding, which was very slight, was arrested. As soon as he
      had recovered sufficiently to speak, he said, addressing a young Italian
      of rank, with whom he was acquainted, and who had been bathing his temples
      with the cold water&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rastelli, you may inform that scoundrel that he has succeeded; rather
      than allow him to escape with impunity, I will undergo the degradation of
      meeting him.&rdquo; He spoke in a low, faint voice, but the expression with
      which he glanced towards Lewis as he pronounced the word &ldquo;scoundrel&rdquo; was
      one of undying hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your Lordship intended to apply that observation to the Signore Luigi,
      I shall have the felicity to explain that your Excellency labours under a
      mistake; that gentleman is the son of a gallant officer, with whom I have
      had the honour to serve in more than one campaign. It is no condescension
      in any one under the rank of a Royal Prince to meet the son of the brave
      Captain Arundel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was an old General Officer in the Austrian service, who
      possessed a European reputation, and whose dictum on all points of honour
      was conclusive. Lord Bellefield bit his under-lip in anger and vexation,
      cursing his own hastiness which had elicited this vindication of his
      enemy: perceiving, however, that he should only place himself still more
      completely in the wrong by any attempt to impugn the old Austrian&rsquo;s
      statement, he merely bowed haughtily in reply, then desiring to be shown
      into a private room, he took Rastelli&rsquo;s arm and quitted the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis stood gazing after his late opponent with a dark and troubled
      countenance; it was not remorse that he experienced, for were the deed to
      have been done over again, he would not have shrunk from its performance;
      and yet the feeling which engrossed him partook of a remorseful character&mdash;it
      seemed to him as though he had now lost all power of free will&mdash;he
      had taken the first step, and <i>the rest</i> must follow; there was no
      longer any possibility of turning back. Like one walking in his sleep, he
      permitted himself to be led into another room&mdash;he heard, as in a
      dream, Rastelli enter and make arrangements with a young Austrian officer
      who had volunteered to act as his second for his meeting Lord Bellefield
      at daybreak. As the person challenged, he had the choice of weapons, but
      he waived his right, and allowed his opponent to select pistols. Ehrenburg
      (his second) whispered to him that Lord Bellefield was reported to be a
      dead shot, but an indifferent swordsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more reason to allow him to choose pistols,&rdquo; was Lewis&rsquo;s careless
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ehrenburg still urged the madness of throwing away a chance. &ldquo;It will be
      no boy&rsquo;s play,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;mark my words, Luigi, this duel will be one for
      life or death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I do not know it?&rdquo; returned Lewis sternly, &ldquo;ay, as well as
      if I now saw him lying dead before my feet,&rdquo; and as he spoke an
      involuntary shudder passed through his powerful frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May not another contingency be possible, <i>buon&rsquo; amico?</i> especially
      if you allow him to secure the advantage of pistols?&rdquo; suggested Ehrenburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to Heaven it might so occur,&rdquo; was Lewis&rsquo;s eager reply; &ldquo;I hope no
      better fate than to die by his hand, believe me; but it will not be so&mdash;I
      know&mdash;I feel it? Ehrenburg, that man has stood like some evil spirit
      across my path; time after time he has heaped insult upon me; once,
      coward-like, the assassin sought my life; but till tonight I have never
      opposed him. Why? because it is written here&rdquo; (and he touched his
      forehead) &ldquo;that when the final struggle shall come, my destiny is stronger
      than his, and he must perish. You may smile and deem my words the mere
      ravings of superstition, but you will see, <i>if</i> we meet to-morrow
      morning, Bellefield will never leave the ground alive, and I shall quit it
      with the brand of Cain upon my brow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so gravely and with such an evident belief in the reality of his
      convictions, that for a moment Ehrenburg himself felt impressed. But a
      duel was no very uncommon event with the young Austrian: he had been
      principal on two occasions, when no serious result had followed, and
      second on half-a-dozen more; besides, he was essentially a practical man.
      So he merely shrugged his shoulders, hinted that Lewis&rsquo;s nerves might be
      excited, which would produce these little fancies, advised him to take a
      cup of coffee, and then repair to the shooting-gallery and practise
      steadily for an hour or so to get his hand in, promised to be with him in
      good time on the following morning, inquired whether he could be of any
      further assistance, and then strolling back to the gaming-table, relieved
      Lewis of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To gain his lodgings and lock himself into his studio was scarcely the
      work of five minutes; then flinging himself upon the first seat that came
      in his way, he gave himself up to bitter thoughts. Two years ago he had
      fled his country, had quitted all who were dear to him, because his fiery
      passions were beyond his control&mdash;because he had loved too deeply and
      hated too bitterly. He had plunged into a life of wild adventure to
      dissipate his feelings; he had schooled his heart in solitude; he had
      devoted all his energies to the acquirement of an art; nay, he had devoted
      the first efforts of the skill he had thus gained to embody a visible
      representation of the danger of ill-bestowed love and the curse of
      gratified revenge; and <i>this</i> was the result!
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained for a few minutes with his head resting on his hands,
      apparently stunned by his conflicting feelings; then rousing himself by an
      effort, he heaved a deep sigh and drew out <i>the glove</i>. As his eye
      fell upon the stain of blood, he shuddered, and hastily putting it from
      him, began pacing up and down the apartment. An antique lamp hung by a
      chain from the ceiling, throwing its light strongly on the two pictures
      from the &ldquo;Giaour.&rdquo; Involuntarily Lewis paused before them, and remained
      gazing from one to the other with an expression of remorse and horror. &ldquo;Am
      I indeed about to realise these creations of my gloomy fancy?&rdquo; he
      murmured; &ldquo;shall I become that human tiger, that stony, soulless image of
      impenitent despair! Revenge, how I have thirsted for it, how, when
      writhing under that man&rsquo;s insults, I have pictured to myself the day of
      reckoning, and deemed life itself would be a cheap sacrifice for one hour
      of unlimited vengeance; and now, when this coveted boon lies within my
      grasp, I see it in its true light, and own this wished-for blessing to be
      a dark, consuming curse. Seen through the distorted medium of outraged
      feeling, retribution appeared an act of justice. The demon wore an angel&rsquo;s
      form. But viewed in its true aspect, the sentiment is that which leads to
      murder, and the deed, with its sickening details, revolting butchery. Yet,
      seeing this clearly, knowing to what it will lead, I <i>must</i> go on: I
      owe <i>him</i> satisfaction. Satisfaction!&rdquo; and he smiled at the mocking
      term. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;I <i>must</i> go on, even if I wished to turn
      back. If I <i>could</i> forego my revenge and forgive him, it is now too
      late. Well, be it so; &rsquo;tis weakness to repine at the inevitable. I
      will meet my fate boldly, be it what it may; and for him, he has brought
      the punishment upon his own head, and must abide the issue!&rdquo; He resumed
      his walk up and down the apartment; then a new idea struck him. &ldquo;What a
      strange expression her features wore when she ventured to address me,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;and in the crowd she did not shrink from me, but trusted herself to
      me with a gentle, child-like confidence.&rdquo; He paused, pressed his hand to
      his forehead, then exclaimed, &ldquo;O God, if I have wronged her&mdash;if&rdquo;&mdash;and
      here his voice sank almost to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;if, Heaven help me, she
      should have loved me after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Completely overwrought by these conflicting emotions, Lewis sank into a
      chair, and burying his face in his hands, struggled in vain for composure,
      a deep-drawn, choking sob from time to time attesting his mental agony.
      How long he remained in this position he never knew. It might have been
      minutes, for he took no note of things external; it might have been hours,
      for a lifetime of heartfelt desolation appeared crowded into that dark
      reverie. He was aroused at length by a tap at the door, which, as at first
      he could scarcely collect his ideas sufficiently to attend to such
      sublunary matters, soon grew into a loud and impatient knocking with the
      handle of a stick or <i>umbrella</i>. Imagining it to be one of his artist
      friends, come probably to bring him information in regard to the late
      disturbances, he replied in Italian that he was particularly engaged and
      could not see any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polite and encouraging, certainly,&rdquo; muttered a deep-toned voice, at the
      first sound of which Lewis sprang from his seat and listened with an eager
      yet half incredulous expression of countenance. &ldquo;A thousand and one
      pardons, Signor,&rdquo; continued the person on the outside, speaking in
      Italian, with a peculiarity of accent which proved him to be unaccustomed
      to pronounce the language, or probably even to hear it spoken; &ldquo;but you
      really must condescend to see me, even if Diabolus himself is supping with
      you, and there is only macaroni enough for two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Lewis flung open the door, and there <i>in
      proprio persono</i> stood Richard Frere <i>and</i> the cotton umbrella!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frere, dear old fellow! is it, can it indeed be you?&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis
      joyfully, forgetting for the moment everything in the surprise of
      welcoming such an unexpected visitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; returned Frere, squeezing and shaking his friend&rsquo;s hand as
      if he had a design of reducing it to a jelly. &ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s himself, and no
      mistake. Lewis isn&rsquo;t <i>him</i>self, though, it seems, but Signore Luigi,
      forsooth. I had hard work to find you, I can tell you. But good gracious!
      what has happened to the man?&rdquo; he exclaimed, catching sight of Lewis&rsquo;s
      bearded face and pale, haggard features, &ldquo;why, he has turned into somebody
      else, bodily as well as in name. You look just like one of these horrid
      Italian fellows, with the proper tragic expression of countenance which
      they get up by way of advertising that they are ready and willing to cut
      throats at half-a-crown a windpipe, country orders punctually executed,
      and the business performed in a neat and tradesman-like manner; but tell
      me seriously, you&rsquo;re not ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in body, nor usually in mind either,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but today
      events have occurred which have thoroughly unmanned me, still I shall &lsquo;win
      through it,&rsquo; somehow; and now tell me of yourself, of Rose, of my mother&mdash;they
      are well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good deal better than you seem to be,&rdquo; growled Frere, who during this
      speech had been attentively observing his friend&rsquo;s features; &ldquo;however,
      I&rsquo;ll soon satisfy your curiosity&mdash;and then you shall satisfy mine,&rdquo;
       he added in an undertone, and removing a wonderful species of travelling
      cap, he followed Lewis, who led the way to his inner apartment, and then
      listened eagerly to Frere&rsquo;s account of the various events which had taken
      place since he had quitted his native land. Rose, by Frere&rsquo;s special
      desire, had, in writing to her brother, hitherto forborne to allude to her
      engagement; the worthy bear, with a characteristic mixture of deep-seated
      humility and surface vanity, fearing that Lewis might not think him a
      fitting match for his sister, and therefore feeling anxious that the
      matter should be disclosed to him in the wisest and most judicious manner
      possible&mdash;by himself <i>viva voce</i>. Thus, after having spoken of
      various less important matters, Frere was gradually working his way
      towards the interesting disclosure with a degree of nervous diffidence
      quite unusual to him, when Lewis, whose attention began to flag, brought
      him to the point by exclaiming, &ldquo;And about Rose, what is she doing: she
      tells me in her letters she still writes for some magazine; but is she
      looking well? does she seem happy? though I suppose,&rdquo; he continued, trying
      to hide his state of mind by falling in with his friend&rsquo;s jesting mode of
      speech, &ldquo;these are minor particulars into which it never occurs to your
      wisdom to inquire. I know your old habit of practically ignoring the
      existence of women as a sex, regarding them as a race of unscientific
      nonentities fitted only &lsquo;to suckle fools and chronicle small beer.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere for a moment looked rather disconcerted; then veiling his
      discomfiture under an affectation of rough indifference, he replied, &ldquo;I
      can tell you one &lsquo;minor particular,&rsquo; as you call it, and that is the fact
      of the young lady in question being engaged to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, starting, &ldquo;you are probably joking,&rdquo; he
      continued seriously; &ldquo;but you know not, dear old friend, how deeply such
      tidings might affect me at this moment; you know not&mdash;how should you?&mdash;the
      mood of mind in which you find me; but tell me in a word, is there any
      earnest in what you have said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a word,&rdquo; muttered Frere, &ldquo;hum! concise and epigrammatical that! but
      I&rsquo;ll try to accommodate you, so here goes by way of answer. Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she has never even hinted at such a fact in her letters,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Lewis; &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind, indeed. I may have&mdash;Heaven help
      me!&mdash;I <i>have</i> neglected my trust, in my self-engrossment; but I
      did not think Rose would have been the person thus to visit my sins upon
      my head. Who is the man?&rdquo; he continued sternly. In the whole course of his
      existence Frere had never felt more uncomfortable; all his old diffidence
      and humility rushed upon him, and for the moment he felt as if he had been
      suddenly detected in an act of petty larceny; however, his sturdiness of
      nature and common sense came to his rescue, and he replied, &ldquo;It is no
      fault of Rose&rsquo;s, for <i>I</i> made it an especial point that she should
      not tell you of her engagement by letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> did, and wherefore?&rdquo; inquired Lewis in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I chose to tell you myself,&rdquo; returned Frere. &ldquo;Your sister is not
      an angel, for angels live in heaven and not on earth, but she is the most
      lovable, the most pure-minded, decidedly the sweetest-looking woman
      (though that does not so much signify) in this world, and I should have
      added, the most sensible, only that she has, in her tenderness of heart,
      seen fit to promise to marry a rough, uncouth animal like me. Lewis, old
      fellow,&rdquo; he continued in a faltering voice, &ldquo;I know better than you can do
      how unworthy I am of such a blessing, but if loving her better than my own
      life gives me any title to possess her, Heaven knows that I do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Frere reached that point in his peroration at which he mentioned
      Rose&rsquo;s promise to marry him, his auditor started, and raising his eyes,
      murmured an ejaculation of fervent thankfulness. As he concluded, Lewis
      clasped his hand eagerly in his own, saying, &ldquo;My dear old Frere, you know
      not how happy you have made me; one great weight, which was crushing my
      soul to the dust ere you appeared, is removed by your words. Of all men
      living you are the one I would have selected for my dearest Rose&rsquo;s
      husband; and now, if I&mdash;that is to say, whatever befalls me she will
      be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are not disappointed?&rdquo; rejoined Frere, greatly relieved; &ldquo;you
      know you used at one time to be just a very little bit ambitious, and I
      fancied you might have been cherishing some splendid scheme for marrying
      Rose to a duke&mdash;she&rsquo;s good enough for the best of &rsquo;em, even if
      dukes were what they should be, instead of what they are too many of &rsquo;em.
      Well, I&rsquo;m very glad!&mdash;but now about yourself&mdash;&lsquo;if anything
      befalls you,&rsquo; you say; pray what is likely to befall you more than any
      other people? and what do you mean by being crushed by a weight, and by
      looking so melodramatically miserable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis heaved a deep sigh, and then replied, &ldquo;You speak jestingly; but
      there are many melodramas less strange than my wayward fortune: such as it
      is, however, I have provoked and will go through with it. Frere, you love
      Rose for her own sake, be kind to and forbearing with my mother for mine&mdash;she
      has many faults, a giddy head, an impulsive disposition (than which there
      can be no greater temptation), but a warm heart&mdash;and&mdash;and I feel
      I have never done a son&rsquo;s duty by her. Frere, you will take care of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The events of the day and evening had well-nigh exhausted even Lewis&rsquo;s
      untiring energy, and the sight of Frere arriving so unexpectedly had
      brought back to him so many home memories, recollections of earlier days,
      ere with the strength and freedom of manhood had come its trials and its
      sins, that as he thought of these old associations and remembered
      kindnesses slighted, affection cast away, duties neglected, for the sake
      of that one master-passion, he forgot for the time the wrongs he usually
      felt so keenly, and remorse for his selfish neglect overwhelmed him and
      caused his voice to falter and his eyes to grow dim with the mist of
      unshed tears. Frere perceived his emotion, and waited till it had in a
      degree subsided; then going up to him, he laid his hand on his shoulder
      caressingly, saying, &ldquo;Come, Lewis, we have known each other from boyhood;
      we have long been brothers in affection, and are soon about to become so
      in name, associated by a still nearer tie&mdash;we never used to have
      secrets from each other, and should not do so now. I have learned from
      Rose the cause you have had for sorrow, and for two years have suffered
      you to try your own method of cure, without attempting to interfere with
      you, but I now see that the experiment has failed, and that you are
      miserable&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis bowed his head in token of assent, he could not trust himself to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not placed in this world to be miserable,&rdquo; continued Frere; &ldquo;true,
      this life is a state of trial, and it would not be so if we had not many
      evils, temptations, and sorrows to endure; but by God&rsquo;s help the evils may
      be borne, the temptations overcome, and the sorrow turned to joy, if we do
      not oppose our will to His; but if we do, sin lieth at the door, we league
      ourselves with the enemy of mankind, and misery must come of it. Do not
      misunderstand me,&rdquo; he added kindly; &ldquo;I do not seek to blame you, I can
      have no pleasure in so doing, but on the contrary deepest pain; still it
      is evident your mind is diseased, and if in probing the wound to discover
      the nature of the evil I hurt you, you must pardon me for the sake of the
      object I have in view. But! am talking at random, for want of a more clear
      insight into the cause of your present difficulty. Come, be frank and open
      with me; let us face the evil boldly, and between us devise some means of
      overcoming it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, suddenly raising his head and
      fixing his piercing eyes full upon his friend&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frere smiled a melancholy smile. &ldquo;Hot-headed, petulant, and jealous of
      interference yet!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My poor Lewis, I did not come to catechise
      you&mdash;affairs of quite another nature brought me here: I am trying to
      carry out an arrangement between my uncle Ashford and your <i>ci-devant</i>
      foe, Lord Bellefield.&rdquo; As he mentioned Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s name Lewis
      shuddered, and his eyes again sought the ground. &ldquo;And now that I have
      cleared up this alarming doubt,&rdquo; resumed Frere, &ldquo;tell me what ails you,
      for that you are miserable, and that I mean to know wherefore, and do my
      best to render you otherwise, are two self-evident facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis useless,&rdquo; returned Lewis in a low voice; &ldquo;the die is cast,
      and neither you nor any one else can help me. Would to Heaven you had come
      a day sooner and taken me away from this accursed place; as it is, my own
      mad passion has hurried me on, and my fate is fixed. Now,&rdquo; he continued,
      glancing at the clock, which stood at a quarter to twelve, &ldquo;I must ask you
      to leave me&mdash;we may meet to-morrow&mdash;or&mdash;if anything should
      prevent it&mdash;and if&mdash;if I have not an opportunity of telling you
      all you seek to know&mdash;my papers&mdash;that is, I will leave you a
      letter explaining everything&mdash;good-night.&rdquo; Scarcely able to control
      his voice in this which Lewis felt might too probably be a last farewell,
      he hurried through the speech in a strange, almost incoherent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frere regarded him fixedly. &ldquo;Unless you condescend to explain to me what
      you purpose doing within the next twenty-four hours,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
      leave you till that time has expired. I tell you what it is, Lewis: I have
      not lived three-and-thirty years in the world without having learned to
      read men&rsquo;s faces, and I read in yours that you are standing on the verge
      of some great folly, madness, or&mdash;crime; and now, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis paused for a moment in deep thought, and then said calmly, &ldquo;Sit
      down, Frere; you are an Englishman, and a man of highly honourable
      feeling; moreover, you are my oldest, my most cherished friend. I am, as
      you say, maddened by circumstances and on the verge of a great crime; sit
      down, I will tell you all, and you shall judge between God and man, and
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calmly, clearly, truthfully, in the deep silence of night, did Lewis
      recount to his friend the strange passages with which the reader is
      already acquainted; he related the simple facts, whether they told for or
      against him, just as they occurred; without entering into unnecessary
      detail he left nothing important unsaid, till Frere had conceived a clear
      idea of Lewis&rsquo;s whole career from the hour he entered Broadhurst to the
      moment in which he was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The upshot of all this is,&rdquo; observed Lewis in conclusion, &ldquo;that I am
      weary of life; littleness, brutality, and oppression in man, weakness and
      treachery in woman, and the tyranny of passion in oneself, render this
      world an incipient hell. To-morrow must end it one way or the other&mdash;either
      he will shoot me or I shall shoot him; the latter contingency I shall not
      long survive; such remorse as I should feel would be unendurable. To save
      myself from the guilt of suicide I shall volunteer into some fighting
      regiment engaged in these civil broils&mdash;Tyrian or Trojan, Austrian or
      Venetian, I care little; my sympathies side with one, my associations with
      the other, and with either I may obtain the only prize I covet&mdash;a
      soldier&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen to me, Lewis,&rdquo; returned Frere gravely. &ldquo;I once at your own
      request promised you that <i>while we both lived I would never give you
      up, but would stand between you and your fiery passions</i>, and I thank
      God who in his mercy has sent me here at this particular moment to enable
      me to fulfil my engagement. You have suffered, and are suffering deeply,
      and from my heart I pity you; but seeing, as I do only too clearly, the
      cause of all this misery, it would be no kindness in me to omit to point
      it out to you. Your two leading faults of character, pride and an
      overweaning degree of self-confidence, are at the bottom of it all. Pride
      made Lord Bellefield your enemy&mdash;when he offered money for the dog he
      never intended to insult you; your proud answer irritated his pride, and
      from that time forth he sought to injure you&mdash;evil produced evil,
      dislike grew to hatred, hatred begat revenge, revenge cherished only
      required opportunity to become developed into assault and murder; that
      opportunity has now arrived, you have been guilty of the first, you
      contemplate the second. So much for pride&mdash;now for self-confidence.
      You imagined nothing could tempt you to forget your dependent position in
      General Grant&rsquo;s family (a position which your pride led you falsely to
      consider a degradation) so far as to forfeit your self-respect by loving
      Annie, so you permitted yourself to enjoy her society till your affections
      were beyond your own control&mdash;mistake number one. Then
      self-confidence whispered that it would be heroic to overcome this
      passion, so instead of avoiding the danger, you stayed to brave it till
      you had sacrificed your happiness, if not hers also&mdash;mistake number
      two. Still untaught by experience, in your own strength you endeavoured to
      crush out the memory of the past; still thinking only of self, you fled
      your country, recklessly severing ties and neglecting duties. Two years&rsquo;
      vain struggling have proved your boasted strength to be abject weakness,
      unable to save you from becoming the slave of your evil passions, and I
      arrive here to find you contemplating the sin of&mdash;well, if I call it
      murder you will deem that I exaggerate, so I will say the sin of gambling
      in a lottery of manslaughter, with every chance against you.&rdquo; Lewis again
      raised his eyes to Frere&rsquo;s face as he replied calmly, but in a cold, hard
      tone of voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have described my miserable career harshly indeed, but in the main
      truly. You profess yourself my friend&mdash;in making this painful
      recapitulation therefore I presume you to have some friendly object; what
      is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First to exhibit to you the disease, then to point out the remedy,&rdquo;
       returned Frere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you can do this,&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis&mdash;&ldquo;if, remembering what I
      am, you can show me how I might have avoided my errors in the past, how I
      may do aught to retrieve them in the future, I will indeed reckon you my
      friend&mdash;nay, I will bless your coming as that of an angel sent from
      heaven to aid a desperate, well-nigh a despairing man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray what religion do you profess?&rdquo; asked Frere abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis started, but recovering himself, replied coldly, &ldquo;The same as you do
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you believe in the truth of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ask such a question?&rdquo; returned Lewis with a slight degree of
      annoyance perceivable in his tone; &ldquo;whatever may have been my faults, I am
      no infidel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you why I ask,&rdquo; replied Frere; &ldquo;because, though you confess
      with your lips the truths of Christianity, in your life you have
      practically denied them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis made no answer, and Frere continued in an earnest, impressive voice,
      his manner becoming every moment more animated as he grew excited with his
      subject&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, as you say you do not doubt, Christianity be true, it amounts to
      this. The God who made and governs this world has been pleased to reveal
      to us His will&mdash;namely, that if we believe in Him and obey Him, He
      will save us from eternal misery and bestow upon us eternal happiness. To
      enable us to fulfil the second condition, that of obedience, He has given
      us a code, not so much of laws as of principles of action, by which we may
      become a law to ourselves. In order to demonstrate how these abstract
      principles are applicable to the exigencies of our mundane career, He sent
      His Son into the world, &lsquo;a man subject to like passions as ourselves, only
      without sin,&rsquo; <i>because</i> he was a consistent embodiment of the
      doctrines he taught. Now had you taken these precepts, to which you accord
      an unpractical and therefore an equally senseless and useless belief, as
      the rule of your actions, how different a result would have followed;
      instead of provoking animosity by haughty looks and proud words, you would
      have remembered that &lsquo;a soft answer turneth away wrath;&rsquo; instead of
      returning evil for evil, you would have considered the example of Him, who
      &lsquo;when He was reviled, reviled not again,&rsquo; and called to mind His precepts,
      &lsquo;resist not evil, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
      despitefully use you and persecute you;&rsquo; instead of seeking to avenge your
      own quarrel by deeds of violence, which outrage nature, and bring their
      own punishment with them even here, in the pangs of conscience, you would
      have thought of His words who hath said, &lsquo;Vengeance is <i>Mine</i>, I will
      repay,&rsquo; and left your cause in His hands. Instead of attempting to do
      everything in your own strength, and failing thus miserably, you would
      have recollected that &lsquo;God&rsquo;s strength is made perfect in our weakness,&rsquo;
      and prayed to Him for support and assistance. Even now, instead of having
      recklessly determined to expose yourself to the chance of committing what
      you own to be a crime of such frightful magnitude, that the remorse it
      must entail on you would be unbearable, the question would be, not, how at
      any sacrifice you must vindicate your honour in the eyes of men, but &lsquo;how
      then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?&rdquo;&rsquo; He paused, then
      asked abruptly, &ldquo;Do you admit all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s features worked convulsively, as in a hollow, broken voice he
      replied, &ldquo;Yes I do, God help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And He will help you,&rdquo; returned Frere, &ldquo;if your repentance is indeed
      sincere; but that must be proved by acts, not words&mdash;Will you give up
      your revenge, and agree not to meet Lord Bellefield tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis fiercely, springing to his feet. &ldquo;The
      sole possession my father bequeathed to me was his name and his spotless
      honour, and it shall never be said that he left them to one whom men had a
      right to call coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet a coward you are,&rdquo; returned Frere sternly, &ldquo;not in the particular
      of brute courage, shared with you by the tiger and the wolf, but in the
      far higher attribute of moral courage, the martyr spirit which enables the
      highest order of minds to endure the scorn of worldly men, rather than
      offend God and degrade themselves by the commission of evil. I will ask
      one more question, and then I have done with you: you say you believe in a
      future and eternal life&mdash;are you fitted to enter upon that life
      to-morrow through the dark portal of a sudden and violent death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Frere uttered these awful words, in a tone of the deepest solemnity,
      Lewis, who had been impatiently pacing the room, stopped short as though
      arrested in his course by a thunderstroke. Placing his hand to his brow,
      he staggered as if about to fall, and Frere sprang up to support him.
      Recovering himself, he murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be alone, in half-an-hour you shall know my decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then opening the door, he motioned to Frere to await him in the
      painting-room, and closing it after him, locked it. What passed in that
      half-hour&mdash;how, prostrate before the Great White Throne, the proud
      man wrestled with his agony, can be known but to One, the Searcher of
      Hearts. When, at the expiration of the prescribed time, the door was
      gently unclosed and Frere entered, he found Lewis, pale indeed and
      trembling, but calm as a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, dear old friend!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;<i>Truth and you have conquered</i>;
      I place myself in your hands&mdash;do with me as you will.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIII.&mdash;SHOWS HOW IT FARED WITH THE LAMB WHICH THE WOLF HAD
      WORRIED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bout nine o&rsquo;clock
      in the evening marked by the occurrence of the events narrated in the last
      chapter, General Grant was informed that a young man, who refused to give
      his name, requested five minutes&rsquo; private conversation with him. Somewhat
      surprised at this demand, the General followed the servant into an
      apartment used by Charles Leicester as a study, and desired that the
      person might be shown in; in another moment a tall, swarthy young fellow,
      dressed in the garb usually worn by the lower classes in Venice, made his
      appearance. As soon as the servant had quitted the room, the stranger
      presented a note to the General, saying, &ldquo;If you will read that, sir, you
      will perceive the object of my visit, and learn the necessity which forces
      me to intrude upon you at such an untimely hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note, which was written in a delicate but somewhat illegible female
      hand, ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dying woman implores you, sir, to visit her; not for her own sake, for
      her hope rests in God and not in man, but for the sake of one who must be
      dearest to you in the world&mdash;your daughter. The writer has
      information to impart to you which may save you and her from years of
      deepest misery. The bearer of this note will conduct you safely to one who
      again implores you by all you hold sacred not to neglect this summons, or
      delay returning with the messenger, lest you should arrive <i>too</i>
      late. The writer pledges her word, the word of one about to enter upon
      eternity, that you shall return safely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very strange note,&rdquo; observed General Grant, suspiciously eyeing
      the young man, who stood awaiting his decision; &ldquo;how am I to know that
      this is not some cunningly devised scheme, dangerous to my life or
      liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you that you may safely trust me,&rdquo; replied the stranger
      eagerly; &ldquo;adopt what precautions you will, leave your money, or aught that
      is of value, at home&mdash;take pistols with you, and if you see any signs
      of treachery, shoot me through the head. I <i>could</i> tell you that
      which would render you as eager to accompany me as you now appear
      unwilling to do so, but I have promised to leave <i>her</i> to explain the
      affair as seems to her best&mdash;she is my sister, and dying; if you
      delay you will arrive too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an Englishman, I presume?&rdquo; inquired the General, still undecided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and have served my country on board a
      man-of-war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sailor! what was your captain&rsquo;s name, and what ship did you belong to?&rdquo;
       demanded the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Prometheus&rsquo;&mdash;Captain Manvers,&rdquo; was the concise answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in her during the year 18&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; continued his
      questioner, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, added, &ldquo;Where were
      you stationed then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We accompanied a convoy of transports, taking the&mdash;&mdash;th and&mdash;&mdash;th
      foot to Madras, and then proceeded to China,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General nodded approvingly. &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Captain Manvers is
      a friend of my own, and I know his vessel to have been then employed as
      you have stated. I will trust you; wait five minutes while I prepare to
      accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within the time he had mentioned General Grant returned, wrapped in a
      military cloak, beneath which he wore a belt supporting a sabre and a
      brace of pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do not return in two hours, give this note to Mr. Leicester,&rdquo; he
      said to the servant who attended them to the door; then motioning to the
      stranger to precede him, he quitted the Palazzo Grassini. Leaving the
      square of St. Mark they advanced towards the Rialto; crossing this, and
      passing the fruit and vegetable market beyond, they reached a spot where a
      gondola was moored. Having stepped into it, the General, on a signal from
      his guide, seated himself near the stern, while the young sailor took an
      oar and assisted his companion in propelling the light vessel. Having
      proceeded some short distance in this manner, the rowers paused at a
      flight of steps. Here the stranger signified to General Grant that they
      must disembark; then resuming his office of guide, he led the way along
      the banks of the canal, and through courts and narrow alleys, inhabited by
      the lower orders of Venice, till he stopped before a rude door. At this he
      tapped twice in a peculiar manner. An old crone appeared in obedience to
      his summons, and cautiously unclosing the door, admitted them. Taking a
      lamp from her hand, the young man led the way up a steep flight of stairs,
      closely followed by his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait one minute,&rdquo; he said as they reached the top; returning almost
      immediately, he continued in a low whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is awake and perfectly collected, but appears sinking fast; she is
      anxious to see you without delay; tread as lightly as possible, and follow
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Advancing a few steps, he opened the door of a bedroom, and the General,
      stooping his head to avoid striking it against the top of the doorway,
      entered. The apartment, though small, was clean and more comfortably
      fitted up than from the external appearance of the house he had been led
      to expect. On a low truckle bed, in one corner of the room, lay the form
      of the dying girl; at a sign from her brother, General Grant approached,
      and seating himself on a chair by the bedside, waited till she should
      address him. For a few minutes she appeared quite unable to do so, and her
      visitor feared, as he gazed on her emaciated form and sunken features,
      that she had indeed delayed her communication till the paralysis of coming
      death had sealed her lips, never again to unclose in this life. In his
      earlier days General Grant had been familiar with death in some of its
      most appalling shapes; he had seen men fall by his side, mutilated by
      ghastly sabre wounds, to be trampled under the hoofs of maddened, plunging
      horses; he had stood immovable when the deadly artillery ploughed up the
      ground around him and mowed down whole ranks as the scythe of the reaper
      prostrates the nodding corn; and when the word of command had gone forth,
      he had led on the stern remnant that were left, till the bayonet avenged
      the losses they had sustained; and when the fight was won, he had sat by
      the couch of some wounded comrade, and watched the strong man battle as it
      were with death, and yield his last sigh in a fruitless struggle with the
      inexorable enemy. But he had never before seen any one worn to the brink
      of the grave by sorrow and disease, and despite his utmost efforts to the
      contrary, the sight shocked and distressed him deeply. The picturesque
      stage of decline had long since passed away, and in the appearance of his
      victim the destroyer stood revealed in his true colours. The features of
      the poor sufferer were characterised by an expression of fatigue and
      distress, that told of long days and weary nights of patient endurance;
      she was so emaciated that the form of the skull and the outline of the
      bones of the cheek and jaw were distinctly visible through the
      parchment-like skin, giving a strange, unearthly appearance to the face,
      while the parched lips, the dark fever spot burning in the centre of each
      cheek, and at intervals the low, husky cough, which once heard can never
      be mistaken, evinced only too surely the presence of that fell disease,
      which seems, as its peculiar attribute, to select its victims amongst the
      young and fair. Her whole appearance was so worn and corpse-like, that
      when, after a paroxysm of coughing, she raised her drooping eyelids and
      fixed her earnest, appealing glance upon her visitor, he started as though
      he had seen one raised from the dead by the agency of some special
      miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank God that you are come, sir,&rdquo; she said in a low, sweet voice,
      &ldquo;that I may yet do some good before I die. I have been the cause of much
      evil in my short life, and I felt it was a duty to tell you the truth of
      my sad history, and do the little that is possible to save another from
      enduring the same misery that has brought me to the condition in which you
      see me.&rdquo; She paused, and the silent, inward cough&mdash;the voice of death&mdash;again
      shook her fragile frame. &ldquo;You do not know me,&rdquo; she resumed; &ldquo;I am Jane
      Hardy.&rdquo; As she mentioned her name the General started, and bending his
      head, drank in her every word with deep attention. &ldquo;About three years
      ago,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;or perhaps rather less, a gentleman who was staying
      at Broadhurst was thrown from his horse while hunting. He was stunned by
      the fall, and some of his companions brought him to our cottage. There was
      no one but myself at home, and I fetched water and bathed his temples. As
      soon as he began to revive, the friends who had brought him said
      laughingly that they could not leave him in better hands, and quitted us
      to follow the hunt. As the gentleman began to recover he entered into
      conversation with me. He was very witty and clever, and told me of the
      fine sights he had seen in foreign lands, and many other beautiful and
      wonderful things which I had never heard of, and before he went away he
      drew me to his side and kissed me, and said he should come again to see
      his kind little nurse, and I&mdash;God help me&mdash;I was young and
      simple, and I believed all he said, and from that hour I loved him. Well,
      sir, he came not only once, but often, and I listened to his soft words
      and specious promises until I ceased to think of or care for anything but
      him. I had no mother to warn me; my poor father had become stem and
      morose, and I feared him and sought only to conceal my attachment from
      him. With some of the facts you, sir, are already acquainted. My father
      was captured on one of his poaching expeditions and sent to gaol. I sat up
      the whole night waiting for his return, and in the early morning came, not
      he whom I was expecting, but my tempter. He told me what had occurred,
      revealed to me for the first time his real rank, promised to obtain my
      father&rsquo;s pardon by means of his wealth and influence, and, as the price of
      his assistance, implored me to fly with him. He could not make me his
      bride in England, he said; his position forbade it; but he vowed he would
      carry me to some bright land in the sunny south, and that we should be
      united and live happily there. Weak fool that I was! I believed him, and
      consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of the tale is soon told. I accompanied him to London; he was
      kind to me, and my dream continued. By his desire I followed him to Rome,
      under the care of his valet. For a time I was treated with every
      attention; servants obeyed me, luxuries surrounded me; but his promise of
      marriage he never fulfilled. Then he began to grow tired of me, and my
      punishment commenced. He soon proved to me the true nature of his
      disposition; his temper was fearful, at once passionate, sulky, and
      vindictive, and I was a safe object on which to vent it. Still I could
      have borne this uncomplainingly if I could have believed that he continued
      to love me. But his coldness and indifference became every hour more
      apparent, till at length I awoke one morning to learn that he had deserted
      me. I discovered his direction and wrote to him. I forbore reproaches; I
      knew that I had lost his love&mdash;I knew, alas! too late, that he had
      never really loved me, and all I sought was to return to England, beg my
      father&rsquo;s forgiveness, and then, if it pleased God, to die. But I entreated
      him to send me money enough to take me home again. He left my letter
      unanswered for a week, and then enclosed me a cheque for five pounds,
      telling me that I had already cost him more than I was worth, and that I
      need expect nothing further at his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the name of this diabolical scoundrel was&mdash;-?&rdquo; inquired
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Bellefield,&rdquo; was the reply, in a clear, distinct, though feeble tone
      of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof can you give me of this?&rdquo; was the cautious rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These letters,&rdquo; returned the girl, producing a small packet from beneath
      her pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General took them, examined the post-marks and the seals, compared the
      signatures with that of a letter he took out of his pocket, read two or
      three of them and then returned them, muttering in a voice that trembled
      with suppressed rage, &ldquo;They are genuine, and they are <i>his</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of my tale is soon told,&rdquo; resumed Jane Hardy. &ldquo;Lord Bellefield
      had left debts behind him, and when it was known he had quitted Rome, not
      meaning to return, those to whom he owed money seized the few valuables
      that I possessed (chiefly dresses and trinkets which <i>he</i> had given
      me), and my last hope, that of returning to England, was taken from me.&rdquo;
       Here a fit of coughing, prolonged till it seemed as though it must
      annihilate her feeble frame, effectually interrupted the speaker. Her
      brother held a strengthening cordial to her parched lips, and after a
      lapse of some minutes she was enabled to resume her narration, though her
      voice was so weak and husky that it was with difficulty her auditor could
      catch her words. &ldquo;I have little more to tell,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suffered much,
      very much misery, but, thanks to the kindness of some sisters of charity
      (rightly were they so called), I was saved from the depths of degradation
      into which too many, deserted as I was, have been forced.&rdquo; Again she
      paused from weakness, and with the tenderness of a woman Miles Hardy wiped
      the cold dews of approaching death from her brow, and put back the rich
      masses of her (even yet) beautiful hair. The General was visibly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nothing be done to save her?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will ascertain who are the
      most skilful physicians in Venice and send them to her. No money shall be
      spared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dark look flitted across Miles&rsquo;s face, but the dying girl turned towards
      the speaker, and a faint smile testified that she had heard and understood
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that my last moments have not been spent in
      vain. Your daughter&mdash;they say she is good and beautiful; he will take
      her heart for the plaything of an hour and then crush it as he has crushed
      mine. You will not let her marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner would I see her stretched on her death-bed before me,&rdquo; was the
      stern rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled again. &ldquo;You have made me so happy,&rdquo; she whispered; then
      with difficulty, and pausing between each word, she continued, &ldquo;Tell him I
      forgive him and pray for him; I pray that he may repent.&rdquo; Again she
      paused, apparently struggling for breath: &ldquo;Miles, it is very dark,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;come nearer, dear!&rdquo; Her brother placed his arm round her, and
      nestling her head in his bosom, an expression of child-like happiness
      spread over her features. Having lain thus for some moments she suddenly
      started up, exclaiming aloud, &ldquo;Oh God! my chest!&rdquo; In a moment the severe
      pain seemed to pass away and the happy smile returned. &ldquo;May He bless you,
      dearest!&rdquo; she murmured; then a solemn change came over her countenance,
      there was a slight struggle, and then&mdash;the jaw relaxed, the eyes
      glazed, and she fell back in her brother&rsquo;s arms a corpse.

      When later on that night women came to perform the last sad offices to the
      dead, an English Bible was found beneath the pillow, and a leaf was turned
      down at the text, &ldquo;Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved
      much;&rdquo; words of mercy we should do well to bear in mind, and humbly trust
      they may indicate the future of many a &ldquo;broken and contrite heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While General Grant was thus occupied, Annie, little dreaming of the
      various events that had occurred, and which so nearly concerned her
      happiness, was thinking over the scenes of the morning, and afflicting her
      spirit by the recollection of Lewis&rsquo;s parting words. What would she not
      give that he could know the truth; know <i>why</i> she had allowed herself
      to be engaged to a man whom Lewis had good reason to believe she both
      disliked and feared; but it was impossible, situated as she was, to
      enlighten him, and she must submit to bear that most bitter of all trials,
      the knowledge that one we love thinks evil of us, and has just and
      reasonable grounds for such misconception. Then her engagement to Lord
      Bellefield, now more hateful to her than ever&mdash;what should she do to
      avoid it? to whom should she turn for counsel and assistance?&mdash;Laura?&mdash;she
      had great faith in her good sense, and, above all, in her energy of
      character&mdash;could she, dare she, confide in her? and she had just
      settled that she certainly could <i>not</i> when a gentle tap was heard at
      the door. Annie cried, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and Laura entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am not disturbing you, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I grew fidgety
      about you, fearing the alarm and fatigue of the morning might have been
      too much for your strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie smiled mournfully and shook her head, at the same time making room
      for her friend on the settee upon which she was reclining. Laura placed
      herself by her side, and taking Annie&rsquo;s hand in her own, stroked it
      caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little hand,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;how soft and white it is, but it&rsquo;s getting
      sadly thin; really, dear Annie, I must lecture you. You eat nothing, and
      your spirits have quite deserted you&mdash;you who were such a happy,
      merry little thing&mdash;it makes me miserable to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a reply, and at length it came, but in a form she did not
      expect, and which tended not at all to remove her anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am very ill, Laura?&rdquo; Annie asked; &ldquo;so ill that I am at all
      likely to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling; I hope&mdash;I trust not,&rdquo; returned Laura earnestly; &ldquo;but
      why do you ask, and in so strange a tone that one could almost fancy you
      wished that it might be so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I do wish it,&rdquo; was the sad rejoinder; &ldquo;if I live I must be very
      unhappy&mdash;there is no help for it, and so I wish to die. Is that
      wrong? I am afraid it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura paused ere she replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are likely to die&mdash;grief kills very slowly. I am
      sure you need not die of grief, or seek to die to escape a life of
      unhappiness, if you would only be reasonable. I love you as I should have
      loved a sister, had I possessed one; my only desire is to render you
      happier; I am a woman, as yourself, and as little likely as you would be,
      were our situations reversed, to do or counsel anything which could wound
      your feelings or compromise your delicacy; and yet you lock your sorrow in
      your own breast, and refuse to give me sufficient insight into your heart
      to enable me to be of the slightest comfort or assistance to you. Is this
      wise or even kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such an appeal, coming at that particular moment, was irresistible. Annie
      threw her arms round her friend, hid her face on Laura&rsquo;s shoulder, and
      sinking her voice almost to a whisper, inquired&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you wish to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dislike Lord Bellefield, and are anxious not to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh, yes!&rdquo; was the unmistakable answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie drew back, but Laura&rsquo;s arm, passed round her slender waist, detained
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love Lewis Arundel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Annie did not reply, but a convulsive pressure of the hand
      answered Laura&rsquo;s question better than words could have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you love him as he deserves to be loved, how could you allow
      yourself to be forced into an engagement with Lord Bellefield?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I, indeed, reveal to you all my folly and weakness?&rdquo; murmured poor
      Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really I am afraid you must, dear, if you wish my advice to be of the
      smallest use to you,&rdquo; returned Laura with a kind, encouraging smile; &ldquo;but
      perhaps the follies may prove not to have been so very foolish, and the
      weaknesses turn out amiable ones after all. Come, let us hear!&rdquo; Thus
      urged, Annie recounted with smiles, and tears, and words, now dropping in
      broken sentences, now poured forth with all the eager vehemence with which
      feelings long restrained at length find vent, that portion of this
      veritable history which especially related to herself, and the rise and
      progress of her unfortunate attachment; until she reached the point
      whereat, overwhelmed by the belief that Lewis had departed from
      Broadhurst, suspecting her love and not reciprocating it, she had
      permitted herself to be hurried into an engagement with Lord Bellefield,
      sacrificing herself to guard against the possibility of any imputation
      being cast upon her maidenly reserve. Here Laura interrupted her by
      exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child! I see it all now; you are to be pitied, not blamed; would
      to Heaven you had known the truth earlier! how much misery it might have
      saved you. Lewis Arundel quitted Broadhurst because he loved you with all
      the impassioned tenderness of his fiery nature, and found even his iron
      will powerless to control or even longer to conceal his feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo; exclaimed Annie, sweeping back her luxuriant
      ringlets from her flushed cheeks, and fixing her large, eager eyes upon
      her friend&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From his own lips when he first heard that you were coming here,&rdquo; was the
      reply. And Annie, pressing her hands to her eyes, hid her face in the sofa
      cushion and burst into tears; but this time they were tears of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when she had in some degree recovered from her agitation, Annie
      learned the history of Lewis&rsquo;s wanderings to cure his love, and how
      signally the remedy had failed, and how he had turned painter, and was
      cleverer than anybody else (a fact of which she felt convinced before she
      heard it), and how Laura had discovered his secret through the medium of
      his sketch of Annie and Faust&mdash;(she did not mention the &ldquo;Giaour&rdquo;
       pictures, fearing to alarm her friend)&mdash;and how Charles and she had
      seen a great deal of him and become very fond of him (oh how Annie loved
      her for saying that!), and how at last one day she had gained his
      confidence and he had told her all, and how she had resolved never to
      breathe a syllable of it to Annie unless she could clear herself in the
      matter of accepting Lord Bellefield, and thus prove herself not unworthy
      to possess the knowledge that the priceless blessing of Lewis&rsquo;s noble and
      generous heart was hers, and hers only. And when Laura had finished,
      Annie, like a true woman, contrived by a series of &ldquo;cunning-simple&rdquo;
       questions to make her tell her tale all over again, particularly those
      portions which related to Lewis&rsquo;s nobleness of nature, and the depth,
      strength, and permanent quality of his affection for herself; and when all
      had been said and re-said that could by any possibility be found to say,
      even on this interesting matter, Annie fixed her soft, imploring eyes on
      her friend&rsquo;s countenance, and asked in a tone of the most innocent but
      complete helplessness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, dear Laura, tell me what <i>is</i> to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up to this moment Laura had considered the whole question to hinge on one
      point&mdash;was Annie worthy of the love of such a man as Lewis, or not?
      This satisfactorily decided, all other difficulties seemed by comparison
      insignificant; but now, when the monster obstacle had disappeared, the
      engagement to Lord Bellefield, the General&rsquo;s obstinacy, Lewis&rsquo;s pride,
      Annie&rsquo;s womanly reserve, and Charley&rsquo;s indolence and dislike of saying or
      doing anything which could by the most remote possibility irritate or
      annoy any one, all flashed across her and bewildered her. Still she had
      great faith in her own energy and in the goodness of her cause, and so
      replied vaguely, but confidently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my love! it&rsquo;s perfectly absurd to give way to despair as you have
      been doing; of course something must, and therefore can and shall be done;
      but what it is to be will, I confess, require some little consideration!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And just when their deliberations had reached this point, Laura received a
      summons from her husband to say that he desired to speak with her; so she
      imprinted a kiss on Annie&rsquo;s smooth brow, and they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Laura, read this,&rdquo; exclaimed Charley, looking worried and
      perplexed, as he handed his wife the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Charles, I have desired your servant to give you this note in case I
      should not return in the course of the next two hours. I am about to
      accompany a young stranger, representing himself to be an English sailor,
      to visit his sister, who is said to be on her death-bed, and has some
      communication to make to me. I have examined the man, and believe his
      tale; but if I should not return within the time specified, it is probably
      a clever fabrication, and as no lie can be framed for other than an evil
      purpose you had better apply at once to the police, and look after me in
      whatever way they may advise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archibald Grant.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LXIV.&mdash;THE FATE OF THE WOLF!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;P</span>leasant that,&rdquo;
       resumed Charley, as Laura, having finished reading the note, returned it
      with looks of alarm. &ldquo;Evans declares it&rsquo;s more than two hours since
      Governor Grant started, and there are no signs of him yet. Why people
      can&rsquo;t stay quietly at home when they&rsquo;ve got a good house over their heads,
      instead of rushing out to seek dangerous adventures, I can&rsquo;t think. I
      should have supposed the General had arrived at a time of life when he
      would have sense enough not to be gulled by messages from girls, either
      living or dying. Perhaps the summons was meant for Bellefield after all,
      and the bearer delivered it to the wrong man; what a joke that would be,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Charles, I don&rsquo;t think it is anything to laugh at,&rdquo; returned
      Laura anxiously; &ldquo;is your brother at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Belle&rsquo;s out too; my family is becoming shockingly dissipated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you not better apply to the police, as the note proposes?&rdquo; urged
      Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police, indeed!&rdquo; muttered Charley: &ldquo;the General can&rsquo;t remember that he is
      out of London. I wonder he did not direct me to send a cab for him. These
      confounded sulky Austrian officials are rather different customers to deal
      with from our blue-bottles&mdash;Messrs. Al &amp; Co. The only thing is to
      go down to the consul&rsquo;s office, and that must be done, I suppose, but it&rsquo;s
      an awful bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Charley yawned, stretched himself, made Laura ring for his
      boots, and had just accomplished the labour of pulling them on, when rapid
      footsteps were heard&mdash;doors opened and shut, and the object of their
      anxiety stood before them, his face flushed with exercise, and his whole
      manner bearing traces of excitement and agitation. &ldquo;Well, General,&rdquo; began
      Charley, &ldquo;we were just going to commence fishing for you in all the canals&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       when his auditor interrupted him by inquiring in a quick, eager voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother is not in the house, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he has been out all the evening, and is not yet returned,&rdquo; was the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us, Laura, there&rsquo;s a good girl,&rdquo; exclaimed the General; &ldquo;stay,&rdquo; he
      continued, as Laura was quitting the room, &ldquo;do not say anything which can
      alarm Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura nodded her acquiescence and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very anxious about your brother,&rdquo; resumed the General. &ldquo;As I was
      returning from this most strange and painful interview, the young man who
      had summoned me still acting as my guide, some person followed us, and as
      we were crossing the Rialto approached, and tapping my companion on the
      shoulder, detained him. They conversed in Italian, but I made out enough
      of what they said to catch the following words spoken by the new-comer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have watched him the evening through. He went from&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; (the
      names of the places I could not hear) &lsquo;to&mdash;&mdash;, which he has this
      moment quitted. Jacopo and the others are prepared; we only await your
      directions. Why have you not joined us sooner?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was impossible,&rsquo; was the reply; &lsquo;but all will yet go as it should.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, turning to me, my guide continued, &lsquo;You have now only to walk
      straight on to reach the Square of St. Mark; no one will interrupt you.
      Farewell, sir; and remember <i>her</i> wishes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This referred to his poor sister, about whom I will tell you another
      time. He and his companion then quitted me. Mechanically I walked forward,
      reflecting on the interview, which had harassed and distressed me greatly,
      till, recalling the words I had just overheard, a new idea struck me, and
      I turned and looked back; as I did so I perceived, at some distance off, a
      man carelessly advancing towards me&mdash;at the moment several others
      rushed out upon him; there was a short struggle, then, as it seemed to me,
      he was overpowered, a cloak was flung over his head, and he was hurried
      away. Instantly I ran to the spot, but it was some considerable distance
      from the place where I had been standing, and when I arrived there, no
      traces of them were visible. The whole affair from beginning to end was
      over in less than a minute, but from the glimpse I had, I feel convinced
      the man I saw carried off was your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, starting, &ldquo;kidnap Bellefield! why, what
      possible motive could anybody have for doing that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One only too powerful&mdash;revenge!&rdquo; was the alarming reply. &ldquo;My guide
      was young Hardy, whose sister Bellefield has cruelly betrayed and
      forsaken. Come, Charles, let us obtain aid to seek and save him: God grant
      we may not arrive too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must now return to Lord Bellefield. After the disturbance at the
      Casino, his lordship, accompanied by Rastelli, repaired to a
      shooting-gallery, where he practised with pistols for an hour. Having by
      repeated successes assured himself that his late fall had not shaken his
      nerves to a degree which could interfere with his skill as a duellist, he
      turned to his companion, observing, &ldquo;Now, Rastelli, devise some method of
      killing time for the next hour or so; I am anxious not to return to the
      Palazzo Grassini till the family have retired for the night. I had rather
      avoid meeting any of them till this little affair is over. What can we
      contrive to do with ourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come home with me, and let us have a quiet game at <i>écarté</i>,&rdquo; was
      the reply; &ldquo;that will amuse without exciting you. I wish you to keep cool,
      in order that you may punish for his temerity the insolent Luigi.&rdquo; As he
      spoke the dark eyes of the Italian flashed with the fire of revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield remarked his eagerness, and smiled contemptuously. &ldquo;Calm
      yourself, my good Rastelli,&rdquo; he said, quietly lighting a cigar; &ldquo;justice
      shall be done, depend on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cold and phlegmatic you English are!&rdquo; exclaimed Rastelli, irritated
      at his companion&rsquo;s apparent apathy; &ldquo;had the brigand insulted me as he has
      insulted you, if I had not stabbed him on the spot, I should have known no
      peace till he lay bleeding at my feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield placed his hand on his friend&rsquo;s shoulder, and approaching
      his lips to his ear, said in a low, impressive voice, &ldquo;Listen! we
      Englishmen do not talk about these things, we <i>do</i> them.&rdquo; There was a
      cold, grating bitterness in his tone, which told of such fiendish malice
      working at his heart that the Italian&rsquo;s display of boyish passion shrank
      into insignificance beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they repaired to Rastelli&rsquo;s dwelling; cards were produced, and
      their game began. With the calculating prudence of an accomplished
      gamester, Lord Bellefield played cautiously and for moderate sums till he
      had tested his adversary&rsquo;s calibre; then, confident in his own skill, he
      artfully led on the young Italian to propose higher stakes, until, at the
      expiration of an hour and a half, he had won above a couple of hundred
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are becoming excited and beginning to play wildly, <i>amico mio</i>,&rdquo;
       he said, pushing back his chair; &ldquo;we will pause for tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when will you give me my revenge?&rdquo; inquired the Italian with flushed
      cheeks and trembling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you like&mdash;to-morrow evening, if it so please you&mdash;always
      supposing our peep-of-day amusement goes as it should do,&rdquo; answered Lord
      Bellefield carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if you should be hit?&rdquo; questioned Rastelli with a grim smile,
      which involuntarily suggested to his auditor the idea that such a
      catastrophe would not deeply distress him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To provide against such a contingency I shall make my will tonight, and
      appoint you executor and residuary legatee; so that when you have
      satisfied the few claims against me, the remainder of my property will be
      yours, to compensate for this evening&rsquo;s run of ill-luck,&rdquo; was the jesting
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rastelli, having by this time in a degree recovered his good humour,
      answered in the same light tone; then having made their final arrangements
      for the morrow&rsquo;s meeting, they shook hands and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Bellefield gained the street, the conventional smile faded from
      his lips, and a dark, sullen expression imparted a gloomy ferocity to his
      countenance. His look did not belie the nature of his thoughts, which ran
      somewhat after the following fashion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty thing I&rsquo;m in for&mdash;to think of that accursed Arundel turning
      up in such an out-of-the-way place as this! my ill-luck follows me
      everywhere. That scoundrel is my evil genius. I shall be rid of him
      to-morrow though, for I&rsquo;ll shoot him like a dog; that&rsquo;s some comfort.&rdquo; He
      paused, then a new idea seemed to strike him, and he muttered, &ldquo;Curse him,
      he means to murder me; I read it in his fiendish eyes. I wonder whether he
      is anything of a shot? A nice way to lose one&rsquo;s life, in a quarrel with a
      tutor! it&rsquo;s next door to going out with one&rsquo;s valet. Well, I&rsquo;m in for it,
      and must chance it; a quick aim and a hair trigger may pick him off, as it
      has done many a better fellow, before he has time to be mischievous. I
      wonder whether Charles or old Grant know of his being here? If not, the
      thing can be easily hushed up.&rdquo; A sound as of a man&rsquo;s footstep caused him
      to start and look round, but seeing no one he resumed, &ldquo;Assassination is
      said to be one of the fashions of this place; I wish I was a little more
      <i>au fait</i> as to the customs of the natives, or had longer time to act
      in. I might get my friend quietly disposed of without risk or trouble.&rdquo; He
      reflected a moment on the feasibility of such a scheme; but the spirit of
      revenge and hate was strong within him, and muttering a fearful curse, he
      added, &ldquo;No!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;him, I&rsquo;d rather shoot
      him with my own hand; that blow sticks by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a man started out from a dark archway so suddenly as nearly
      to run against Lord Bellefield, who, drawing himself up indignantly, was
      about to commence an angry remonstrance, when his elbows were pinioned
      from behind, some person tripped up his heels, a cloak was flung over his
      head, and despite his attempts to free himself, he was overpowered and
      hurried away by a party of several men. After proceeding some short
      distance they reached the bank of a canal; here they paused, and still
      holding the cloak over the captive&rsquo;s head to prevent him from giving an
      alarm, they bound his hands. One who seemed to possess authority over the
      others superintended this operation in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so tight,&rdquo; he said to an over-zealous individual who was tying the
      cord as though it were never to be unfastened, &ldquo;not so tight, it will numb
      his arms. Now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;raise him carefully;&rdquo; and in obedience to
      his command Lord Bellefield felt himself lifted from his feet and placed
      in a lying posture at the bottom of what he rightly imagined to be a
      gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having ascertained by listening that a portion of his captors were engaged
      in rowing the boat, Lord Bellefield made an effort to remove the cloak
      from his face, at the same time slightly raising himself; immediately a
      heavy hand pressed him down, and a deep, low voice uttered the following
      caution, &ldquo;There is the point of a knife within an inch of your heart; if
      you again attempt to move or speak I plunge it in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus warned, nothing remained but to lie still and await his captor&rsquo;s
      pleasure, which alternative, distracted by mingled rage and fear, Lord
      Bellefield was forced to adopt. From the time occupied by their transit it
      appeared that they must have proceeded some considerable distance ere the
      gondola again stopped. Carefully guarded as before, the prisoner was taken
      on shore, and half-led, half-carried over some uneven, stony ground, in
      traversing which his conductors were more than once forced to turn aside
      as if to avoid some obstacle that lay in their path; he was then told to
      ascend steps; doors were unbarred to afford them ingress, and the air
      struck cold and damp, as from a vault. At length, apparently, they reached
      their destination, and the prisoner was made to sit down on a stone bench;
      a light was procured, and then the order was given, &ldquo;Untie his hands,
      remove the cloak, and leave us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The persons spoken to obeyed, and in another moment Lord Bellefield was
      able to look round him. The chamber in which he found himself was small,
      the roof was high and vaulted, and the walls appeared of an immense
      thickness; the door was of oak, thickly studded with iron nail-heads;
      there was no fireplace; a ship&rsquo;s lantern, hanging by a cord from the roof,
      dimly lighted the apartment, and a grated window, sunk in the thickness of
      the wall, seemed to afford the only means of communication with the
      outward air. As Lord Bellefield became aware of these particulars the men
      who had released his hands and removed the cloak quitted the room, locking
      and barring the door on the outside; in another moment the sound of their
      retreating footsteps echoed along the stone passage and died away in the
      distance. A shudder passed over Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s frame as he found
      himself thus strangely left alone with one whose purpose he could scarcely
      imagine other than hostile. As his companion&mdash;who wore one of those
      half-masks termed a domino, which effectually concealed his features&mdash;did
      not seem inclined to address him, Lord Bellefield had time to examine,
      with a beating heart, the preparations made for his reception. The only
      article of furniture the apartment contained, with the exception of the
      stone bench on which he was seated, was a heavy oak table. At the end
      nearest him lay a cutlass, the blade crossed by that of a stiletto, in
      front of which was placed a loaded pistol. A similar arrangement of
      weapons garnished the other end of the table, at which stood the
      motionless figure of the stranger. The whole thing was so strange, and so
      like some fancy of a horrible dream, that it was with difficulty Lord
      Bellefield could believe the evidence of his senses. At length the silence
      became unendurable to such a degree that, even at the risk of hurrying on
      his fate, he resolved to break it. Addressing his captor, he asked, in a
      voice which trembled in spite of his efforts to appear cool and
      indifferent, &ldquo;What place is this to which you have brought me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person addressed paused a moment, and then, without removing his mask,
      replied, &ldquo;A vault in the ruins of a convent on an island in the lagunes, a
      mile from Venice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up to this moment Lord Bellefield had been possessed with a secret belief
      that his captor was none other than Lewis Arundel; and having already had
      a convincing proof both of his enemy&rsquo;s bodily strength and of the
      implacable nature of his feelings towards him, the idea that he had
      kidnapped him and carried him off to this desolate place in order to force
      upon him a combat <i>à l&rsquo;outrance</i>, with weapons in the use of which
      his skill as a duellist would avail him little, was by no means an
      agreeable one. This fear his companion&rsquo;s speech had dispelled, for the
      voice, though deep and stern, was not the voice of Lewis. Ignorant of the
      existence of any other person likely to nourish deep feelings of revenge
      against him, Lord Bellefield immediately conceived that he had fallen into
      the hands of some English ruffian connected with banditti, in which case
      their object would probably be plunder; and the solitary chamber, the
      naked weapons, etc., mere scenic arrangements got up for the sake of
      intimidating him, and so making a better bargain. Much relieved by this
      view of the affair, he began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your object in bringing me here is of course plunder, all this absurd
      mummery is therefore utterly needless; you have only to name some
      reasonable sum for my ransom, and as I cannot get out of the scrape
      otherwise, I must pay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find it no mummery, and are wrong in supposing money will be of
      the slightest avail to you,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield, however, still considering his idea a right one, and
      accounting for this speech as he had already accounted for the presence of
      the weapons&mdash;viz., as a means of intimidating him, in order to extort
      from his fears a higher ransom, continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow, you have completely mistaken your man; all your tragedy
      nonsense is quite thrown away upon me. The affair is simply a matter of
      business: you require money, and knowing my rank, imagine me a Croesus. I
      am nothing of the kind, but I can make it well worth your while to set me
      free; conduct me safely to the Square of St. Mark, and I will give you a
      hundred Napoleons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million curses on your money!&rdquo; exclaimed the other furiously; &ldquo;may the
      bitter malediction of a desperate man cleave to the rank and riches which
      have served to add a false splendour to as mean and pitiful a scoundrel as
      ever disgraced God&rsquo;s earth. Fool! let me undeceive you&mdash;I am Miles
      Hardy&rdquo; (as he spoke he flung down his mask), &ldquo;the brother of Jane&mdash;your
      victim&mdash;I have brought you here <i>to die</i>. Now do you think your
      money, that money which you refused to give to save her from a life of
      infamy, or a beggar&rsquo;s death, is likely to bribe me to change my purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Lord Bellefield was utterly confounded by this declaration;
      he had never been aware that Jane possessed a brother, and the surprise
      added to his discomfiture; besides, hardened as he was, he knew that he
      had deeply wronged the girl, and a superstitious instinct of the justice
      of the retribution which had overtaken him helped still more effectually
      to terrify and crush him: for once both his haughty spirit and his
      presence of mind failed him, and mistaking the character of the man with
      whom he had to deal, he resolved first if possible to deceive, then to
      cajole and bribe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refuse money to Jane Hardy!&rdquo; he began in a tone of feigned surprise; &ldquo;you
      must have strangely deceived yourself: while she remained with me I
      lavished hundreds upon her, and when, with the caprice of her sex, she
      chose to leave me for some more favoured swain, as I imagine, ignorance of
      her abode alone prevented my settling a liberal allowance upon her. Even
      now I am ready to do so if she wishes it&mdash;where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of contemptuous anger, which had overspread Miles Hardy&rsquo;s face as
      Lord Bellefield uttered these falsehoods, gave place to an expression of
      deep solemnity as he replied, &ldquo;She is where you will be ere another hour
      has passed, wretched liar that you are&mdash;gone to answer for her sins
      before her God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Bellefield, involuntarily shocked into an
      expression of feeling. Miles regarded him attentively; had he discerned in
      him any symptoms of real grief for her loss, any signs of true penitence
      for the destruction he had wrought, there was that working in the
      brother&rsquo;s heart which might even yet have saved him. But a doom was upon
      the seducer, and a fresh display of his evil, sordid nature hastened it.
      &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo; &rsquo;pon my word, Hardy, I&rsquo;m quite shocked at
      this sudden intelligence; I really was excessively fond of her at one time&mdash;a&mdash;I
      mean to say, before she chose to run away from me. However, you must not
      take the affair so deeply to heart: I can assure you these things are
      happening every day, and I always meant to make her a liberal settlement;
      but as that is now unfortunately impossible, we must see what can be done
      for you.&rdquo; Having delivered himself of this heartless speech, which he
      considered a model of diplomacy, Lord Bellefield paused to observe its
      effects upon his auditor. Miles stood for a moment as if absorbed in
      grief, murmuring to himself, &ldquo;My poor Jane, and was it for such a thing as
      this you sacrificed your young life? My poor, poor sister!&rdquo; Then suddenly
      raising his head, he said, with a glance of the most withering scorn&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mean lies will prove of as little use to you as your money; I loathe
      it, them, and you alike. I have told you I brought you here to die, and I
      have told you true; but I am no assassin, and if you have the courage of a
      man, you have one chance yet remaining. On that table lie six weapons,
      three for you and three for me; choose which you will, and come on; only
      if the first fails we must try the second, and if that does not end the
      matter there still remains the third. Come, make your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but hear me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Lord Bellefield, turning very
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; was the angry answer, &ldquo;instantly defend yourself. If you
      refuse, I will shoot you where you stand;&rdquo; so saying he advanced a step
      towards the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bellefield, who had risen during the last speech, slowly followed his
      example, casting, as he did so, a scrutinising look round the apartment,
      and especially towards the window; the action did not escape Hardy&rsquo;s quick
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your search is useless,&rdquo; he said, smiling contemptuously. &ldquo;Were you here
      alone, with proper tools at hand, and knowing how to use them to the best
      advantage, it would take you two hours to break out of this place. If you
      call ever so loudly, there is no one to hear you&mdash;my companions are
      half-way back to Venice by this time. You have nothing left but to
      overcome me, or to die the dog&rsquo;s death you deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis false!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Bellefield eagerly; &ldquo;my friends have
      succeeded in tracing me, and even now I hear the tread of soldiers in the
      passage&mdash;hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture of surprise Hardy turned towards the door. This was all
      Lord Bellefield required. Springing forward, he seized the pistol nearest
      to him, levelled it, and with the speed of thought, fired. Looking round,
      Hardy perceived too late the snare that had been laid for him. As he did
      so, a sharp, stinging pain, followed by a sensation like the burn of a
      red-hot iron, passed round his left side. The ball, aimed at his heart,
      had struck against the handle of a clasp-knife which, sailor-fashion, he
      wore slung round his neck by a string, and glancing off, entered the side
      and passed round one of the ribs under the skin, lodging among the
      muscular fibres of the shoulder-blade. Furious at the cowardly stratagem
      to which he had so nearly fallen a victim, and half-maddened with the pain
      of his wound, Hardy seized the other pistol, and shouting, &ldquo;Die, you
      infernal, treacherous scoundrel!&rdquo; snapped it at his adversary; but owing
      to the priming being damp, the pistol rusty, or from some other
      unexplained cause, the cap exploded without discharging the weapon.
      Flinging it down with an oath, he snatched up the sword that lay nearest
      to him, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Come on, and be &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to
      you!&rdquo; scarcely gave his antagonist time to follow his example, ere he
      attacked him furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two cut and thrust followed each other so rapidly that all
      seemed confusion. Then as their first fury became expended, and they
      fought more cautiously, Lord Bellefield perceived, to his extreme
      satisfaction, that he was the better swordsman of the two, Hardy having
      merely picked up the use of the cutlass on board a man-o&rsquo;-war, while his
      antagonist had learned fencing amongst the other military exercises of a
      cavalry regiment in which, till within the last two or three years, he had
      held a commission. If, therefore, he could contrive to defend himself till
      Hardy&rsquo;s fury should have in some degree worn out his strength, he trusted
      either to disarm his adversary, or by a well-directed thrust to rid
      himself of him for ever. Nor was he disappointed in this expectation; for
      having with some difficulty parried a furious thrust, he caught Hardy&rsquo;s
      sword with the blade of his own weapon, and by a sudden turn of the wrist
      sent it flying out of his hand, leaving his enemy defenceless and at his
      mercy. But mercy being a quality for which his lordship was never famous,
      more especially when, as in the present instance, its exercise might
      compromise his own safety, he drew back a step to get room for his thrust,
      with the intention of running his opponent through the body. With the
      speed of lightning, Hardy perceived the only chance remaining for him, and
      unhesitatingly adopted it. Snatching up one of the stilettos, he rushed
      upon Lord Bellefield, and receiving his thrust through the fleshy part of
      his left arm, closed with him and buried the dagger in his heart. Uttering
      a sound between a gasping sob and a groan, the young nobleman staggered,
      raised his arm as if in the act to strike, and fell back a corpse.

      Thus did the vengeance of the great God whom he had insulted by a life of
      selfish crime overtake this wicked man in the pride of his youth and
      strength, and thus in the same night were the libertine and his victim
      called to appear before the Judge of all the earth to answer for their
      deeds, whether they had done good, or whether they had done evil. For the
      humble penitent we may indeed sorrow, yet not as without hope; but for the
      impenitent sinner, cut off in the midst of crime, dying with his selfish
      heart untouched, his evil nature unregenerated, &ldquo;there remaineth no longer
      any hope, but a fearful looking-for of judgment to come.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXV.&mdash;FAUST PAYS A MORNING VISIT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rere, on the
      principle of striking whilst the iron is hot, had no sooner obtained
      Lewis&rsquo;s promise to place in his hands the arrangement of the quarrel
      between Lord Bellefield and himself than he induced his friend to write a
      carefully worded apology for having in the heat of passion assaulted his
      lordship on the previous evening. Lewis took the pen, and without a murmur
      wrote as Frere dictated, his compressed lips and knitted brow alone
      telling of the martyrdom his proud spirit was undergoing; but his strength
      of will was as powerful for good as for evil; he had resolved on the
      sacrifice, and cost what it might, he <i>would</i> make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, what is your intention?&rdquo; he inquired, as Frere, having signified
      his approbation of its contents, folded the note and deposited it safely
      in his pocket-book. &ldquo;Suppose Bellefield should refuse to accept this
      apology?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; was the confident reply, &ldquo;he <i>must</i> accept it; and to
      tell you the truth, although he may bluster and give himself airs when he
      perceives you are not forthcoming, I expect he will only be too glad to be
      quit of such an awkward customer. I don&rsquo;t wish to be personal, but depend
      upon it you are by no means pleasant as an enemy; there is &lsquo;a lurking
      devil in your eye,&rsquo; as Byron says (and he ought to know about devils, for,
      adopting the fallen angel hypothesis, he was very like one himself), that
      would try a man&rsquo;s nerve rather when he found himself standing opposite
      your loaded pistol at eighteen paces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil has been pretty well taken out of me this time,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;henceforth I shall be essentially a man of peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, pressed his hand to his brow, and a slight shiver passed
      through his frame. Frere regarded him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you shivering about?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel ill, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is nothing,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I have, as you may easily imagine,
      gone through a good deal, both mentally and bodily, of late, and I am a
      little overworn; but a couple of hours&rsquo; sleep will set me right again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the sooner you take it the better,&rdquo; rejoined Frere. &ldquo;Never mind me;
      I shall ensconce myself in this arm-chair till the man of war, your
      second, makes his appearance, and sleep or read as the Fates may incline.
      What time do you expect your accomplice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be here at half-past four,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is now just two; so turn in, and pleasant dreams to you.&rdquo; Thus
      saying, Frere threw himself back in the chair, and drawing a volume of
      Dante out of his pocket, set to work to polish up his Italian, as he
      termed it. Lewis rose to follow his friend&rsquo;s advice, but a mist seemed to
      swim before his eyes, his brain reeled, his trembling knees refused to
      support him, and staggering forward he sank heavily to the ground in a
      fainting fit. Frere, much alarmed, raised him in his arms, and carrying
      him with some difficulty into the inner room, laid him on his bed, and
      began, with more energy than skill, to apply every conceivable or
      inconceivable remedy to recover him, but with only partial success, for
      although after the lapse of a few moments colour returned to his lips and
      pulsation to his heart, he neither spoke nor appeared to recognise his
      friend&rsquo;s voice, and after a few inarticulate murmurs sank into a dull,
      heavy sleep. Frere covered him with the bedclothes as well as he was able,
      then drawing a chair to the bedside, seated himself thereupon to watch his
      slumbers. Half-past four arrived, and with it Major Ehrenburg, the
      Austrian officer who had promised to act as Lewis&rsquo;s second. Before he came
      a new idea had entered Frere&rsquo;s head&mdash;it might not be necessary to
      make use of the apology at all, Lewis&rsquo;s sudden illness would be a
      sufficient reason for his not meeting his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The amusement you have promised yourself in seeing my friend shoot or be
      shot you will be disappointed of, <i>Mein lieber Herr?</i>&rdquo; he said with a
      quiet smile, as the Austrian stared at him in surprise and twisted his
      moustaches fiercely. &ldquo;Lord Bellefield in his angry moods is no doubt a
      very terrible fellow, but Lewis is about to wrestle with a more deadly foe
      yet, or I am much mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, sir, I have no time for badinage,&rdquo; returned the other, bowing
      with haughty politeness; &ldquo;<i>nothing</i> can prevent this duel. I must
      speak with the Signore Luigi himself immediately. Permit me to pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; replied Frere, holding open the door of the bedroom; &ldquo;but
      in regard to nothing being able to prevent the duel, &lsquo;there are more
      things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your
      philosophy.&rsquo; You will find my words to be true. See, his adversary has
      laid him on his back already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young soldier advanced to the bedside; Lewis still slept, but his
      slumbers were disturbed and feverish. As the other bent over him he turned
      uneasily and murmured some inarticulate sounds. Laying his hand on his
      shoulder, Ehrenburg attempted to rouse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luigi,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is late; they will be on the ground before us.&rdquo; The
      only reply was again an inarticulate murmur; but on his repeating his
      summons Lewis sat up and stared about him with a look of dull
      unconsciousness, then a wild light came into his eyes, and glaring
      furiously at the Austrian, he exclaimed in a hoarse voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain, it is false! she loves you not&mdash;she never loved you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not know me Luigi?&rdquo; inquired Ehrenburg in a more soothing tone of
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know you, scoundrel, yes! On earth, or in the lowest hell, I should know
      and hate you.&rdquo; He paused, glanced wildly round the room, then exclaimed in
      a voice scarcely audible through passion, &ldquo;What I here in my own house do
      you come to triumph over and to insult me? This is too much.&rdquo; And with a
      scream of fury he made a spring at the other&rsquo;s throat, which he would have
      succeeded in grasping, probably to his severe injury, had not Frere, who
      had watched him closely during the foregoing scene, thrown himself upon
      him, and with the assistance of the young soldier, who at length began to
      perceive the true state of the case, contrived to hold him down, till,
      exhausted by the violence of his struggles, he ceased to resist any
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have exposed himself to malaria, and the fever has attacked the
      brain&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo; inquired Ehrenburg as soon as he had recovered
      breath enough to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I fear,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Malaria, or macaroni, or some horrid foreign
      thing or other, has brought on a violent fever, and, as you see, he is now
      about as mad as a March hare (though perhaps a belief in that popular
      zoological delusion may not extend to the Austrian dominions)&rdquo;&mdash;this
      last remark was made <i>sotto voce</i>. &ldquo;And now, Mein Herr, the sooner
      you&rsquo;re off the better, for Lord Bellefield, unless he is much belied, is
      not particularly famous for patience. You&rsquo;ll explain to him why Lewis
      can&rsquo;t do himself the pleasure of shooting him this morning; and you may
      add, with my compliments&mdash;Richard Frere&rsquo;s, at your service&mdash;that
      it&rsquo;s better luck than he deserves. By the way,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if you
      could give one a hint how to come by such an article as a doctor I should
      esteem it an additional favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call at the residence of an English physician as soon as I leave
      this house,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;fortunately, one who is reckoned very skilful
      resides within a few doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; returned Frere, &ldquo;none of your foreign quacks for me.
      Doctors are bad enough all the world over, I dare say; but an English one
      is a degree better than any of your homoeopathic, mesmeric,
      electro-biologic, clairvoyant humbugs&mdash;<i>Al piacer di revedervi</i>,
      Signore; I mean, <i>Leben sie wohl, mein Herr</i>. A mustachioed, laced,
      and padded young puppy!&rdquo; he continued, as, with a haughty bow and a
      puzzled expression of countenance, the young Austrian quitted the
      apartment; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t he be content with cutting throats himself without
      encouraging his neighbours to go and shoot at one another! I hate a fellow
      who will be second in a duel as I hate a professional hangman. I&rsquo;d half a
      mind to let poor Lewis strangle him&mdash;a foreigner more or less is no
      great matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician&rsquo;s opinion coincided with that of Richard Frere. Overwrought
      both in mind and body, Lewis had been attacked by fever of the most
      virulent nature, and every resource that the science of medicine afforded
      appeared powerless to subdue it. Night and day Richard Frere sat by the
      sick man&rsquo;s bedside, listening with an aching heart to his fevered ravings.
      Now, for the first time, did he become aware of the depth and strength of
      that passion which, having destroyed its victim&rsquo;s peace of mind, seemed
      about to finish its work of devastation by sapping the very springs of
      life itself. In his delirium the idea appeared to have fixed itself in
      Lewis&rsquo;s imagination that the duel had taken place, and that Lord
      Bellefield had perished by his hand; and the agonised self-reproaches
      which his remorse forced from him were painful to listen to. Occasionally
      he would appear to forget even this, and imagining himself in the presence
      of her he loved, would breathe forth expressions of the deepest
      tenderness, when suddenly the recollection of his supposed guilt would
      flash across him, and upbraiding himself in the bitterest terms, he would
      exclaim that a bar existed between them, and declare himself a murderer
      accursed before God and man. And so the weary days wore on, and the
      sufferer grew paler and weaker, while still the fire which was consuming
      his young life burned fiercely as at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day following the night of Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s death was a remarkable
      one, for it witnessed the assassination of the unfortunate Marinovitch,
      whose courage and strong sense of duty forbade him to desert his post,
      even in order to preserve his life; this act of dastardly revenge heralded
      the revolt in Venice. The Palazzo Grassini was, as may be supposed, the
      scene of much alarm and anxiety. General Grant and Leicester had been
      foiled in their attempt to trace the after proceedings of the party who
      had kidnapped Lord Bellefield, nor was any light thrown upon his
      mysterious disappearance until another night and day had elapsed, when, in
      consequence of a high reward offered by the family to any person who could
      afford information in regard to the affair, an individual in the garb of a
      gondolier sought an interview with General Grant. This worthy (who was
      none other than Jacopo, the bravo whose stiletto had so nearly proved
      fatal to Lewis) having bargained for the promised reward and for a free
      pardon for his own share in the transaction, confessed that he and certain
      of his associates had been engaged by an Englishman named Hardy, with whom
      he had been for some months acquainted, to seize and carry off a
      gentleman, against whom Hardy, for some reason, appeared to nourish a deep
      revenge; that this gentleman had been staying at the Palazzo Grassini; and
      that Hardy having pointed him out to him, he (Jacopo) had watched him the
      whole evening, and finding he remained abroad so late, had arranged to
      waylay him as he returned home, and succeeded in his design, though the
      plan was nearly being frustrated by the unexpected absence of Hardy, who
      however joined them at the last moment. He then communicated those details
      of the enterprise with which the reader is already acquainted, up to the
      time when he left Hardy and Lord Bellefield together in the ruined
      convent, beyond which he either was, or affected to be, ignorant in regard
      to the affair. The clue thus gained was, however, sufficient. Led by
      Jacopo to the room in which the duel had taken place, the General and
      Leicester soon found their worst fears realised. The body lay covered with
      a cloak, on which was pinned a paper, written by Hardy before the duel,
      stating his intention of forcing Lord Bellefield to a mortal combat,
      adding that when that paper was found either one or both of them would
      have gone to their long account; at the bottom was scrawled in pencil&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have kept my word; he brought his fate upon his own head&mdash;no one
      had any hand in his death but myself; he fell in fair fight, having
      wounded me severely, but, as I think, not mortally.&mdash;(Signed) Miles
      Hardy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Leicester&rsquo;s early affection for his brother was brought back by his
      dreadful fate, and he wept over his corpse like a woman. The General
      shuddered slightly when his eye first perceived the expression of rage and
      hatred stereotyped on the rigid features of the dead man&rsquo;s face, then his
      brow contracted and his mouth grew stern as he turned to issue directions
      for the murderer&rsquo;s apprehension. Whether, being Italians, the police
      looked upon manslaughter with a favouring eye, or whether the disturbed
      state of the city facilitated his escape, certain it is that Miles Hardy
      contrived to evade the search made for him; and after offering large
      rewards for his apprehension, and using every other means in his power to
      stimulate the exertions of the police, General Grant was fain to rest
      satisfied that he had done all which the strictest sense of duty could
      command at his hands. Perhaps, as the memory of the scene he had witnessed
      by Jane Hardy&rsquo;s death-bed recurred to him, and he thought of the cruel
      provocation her brother had received, even the stern old soldier might be
      glad that he had not been called upon to condemn Miles to an ignominious
      and painful death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feelings both of Laura and Annie, when they became acquainted with
      this frightful catastrophe, may easily be imagined. From Laura it was
      impossible to conceal it, for, unused to deep emotion of any kind, her
      husband&rsquo;s grief was for the time so overpowering that he completely lost
      all self-control, and it was only by the judicious exercise of her good
      sense and tenderness that she was enabled to restore him to anything like
      composure. Nor had she a much easier task with Annie, for a superstitious
      but not unnatural fancy seized her that (her earnest desire to avoid a
      union with Lord Bellefield having been thus fearfully accomplished) she
      was in some degree morally guilty. But Laura, tender, kind, judicious
      Laura, with her man&rsquo;s head and her woman&rsquo;s heart (a rare alliance,
      constituting human perfection), argued and soothed and coaxed and
      reasoned, until Annie&rsquo;s self-upbraiding horror yielded to her gentle
      persuadings, as did of old the demon which tormented Saul to the melody of
      David&rsquo;s harp: and indeed there is on earth no music sweeter than a loving
      woman&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time poor Walter found himself sadly neglected. After the
      affair at the Casino, Mr. Spooner, ignorant of Lewis Arundel&rsquo;s illness,
      and fearful that he would keep his word and inform General Grant of the
      shameful manner in which he had betrayed his trust, found some plausible
      excuse for resigning his situation and returning to England, at the
      General&rsquo;s expense, before any exposure should take place. So he wrote
      himself a letter announcing the death of his mother (at that moment
      drinking brandy and water in the bar of a hotel in Birmingham, whereof she
      was landlady), and leaving three orphan sisters (invented for the
      occasion) solely dependent on him for <i>everything</i>; which epistle
      answered his purpose nicely. After his departure Walter was left pretty
      much to his own devices; and one of his chief amusements was drilling and
      talking to Faust, for whom all his old fondness had revived since the
      interview in which he had made up his quarrel with Annie. He was therefore
      especially annoyed and perplexed by a habit which the dog had lately
      acquired of absenting himself every day for several hours. Various were
      the schemes Walter laid to discover what became of the animal, but by some
      fatality they all failed to effect their object; and the cause of the
      dog&rsquo;s absence, as well as the mode in which he contrived to effect his
      egress, still remained a mystery. At length, one evening, as Walter was
      sitting at a window of the Grassini palace which looked into a small
      courtyard or garden enclosed by a high wall, his attention was attracted
      by observing something which in the short glimpse he had of it appeared
      like an animal&rsquo;s head pop up above the wall and disappear again. Watching
      the spot carefully, Walter soon witnessed a repetition of the phenomenon;
      but this time a rough, hairy body and legs followed the head, and after a
      slight scramble the delinquent Faust himself made his appearance at the
      top of the wall, which was sufficiently broad to afford him a precarious
      footing: he then deliberately, but with great caution, walked along the
      narrow causeway thus afforded, until he reached a spot where the limb of
      an old tree grew so as nearly to touch the wall; upon this he got, and
      contrived, by a mode of progression half-slipping, half-clambering, to
      arrive at a point whence he could easily jump to the ground. All these
      manouvres Walter carefully noted, and formed his plan accordingly. The
      boy&rsquo;s curiosity&mdash;(we continue to use the term boy, for although in
      age and appearance poor Walter was now almost a man, in mind he was still
      far younger than his years, in spite of those occasional flashes of
      intelligence so often to be observed in cases of partial mental
      imbecility, which render a just estimate of the individual capacity so
      difficult to arrive at)&mdash;Walter&rsquo;s curiosity was thoroughly aroused by
      this discovery, and he determined if possible to find out the nature and
      object of Faust&rsquo;s clandestine expeditions. That he had some definite
      object Walter never for a moment doubted, for he had so completely made a
      friend and companion of the dog, that he had learned to look upon him much
      more as a reasonable being than as an animal guided only by an enlightened
      instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of that day, and from an early hour on the following morning,
      Walter never lost sight of the dog, though he contrived to effect his
      purpose without interfering with its liberty of action. At length his
      patience was rewarded by seeing Faust enter the garden and begin to
      scramble up the identical tree, by means of which he had effected his
      descent on the previous day. Seizing his hat, Walter lost no time in
      following him; the tree was easy to climb, and the same branch which had
      afforded a passage for Faust enabled Walter to reach the top of the wall
      in safety. On the other side the difficulties were still less, for the
      ruins of some ancient building lay scattered in all directions, and a pile
      of them actually came within a few feet of the top of the wall, forming a
      rough but efficient flight of steps. By the time Walter regained <i>terra
      firma</i>, however, Faust had proceeded some distance, and had he chosen
      to run on might still have preserved his secret inviolate. But when Walter
      called him, he stopped and waited till his friend approached, though
      neither threats nor endearments could prevail upon him to turn back, or to
      allow Walter to come near enough to lay hold of him. And so the pair
      proceeded, Faust running on for a short distance, waiting till Walter drew
      near, and then resuming his course. The route the dog pursued avoided the
      more frequented ways, and Walter began to think Faust was merely taking a
      stroll for the benefit of his constitution, when the animal suddenly
      turned down an archway, and looking back to see that his friend followed,
      proceeded along a narrow alley which led into one of the smaller streets,
      and stopped at the door of a house which projected beyond some of the
      others. The door stood ajar, and Faust without ceremony pushed it further
      open and walked in. Walter paused, debating as well as his mental capacity
      enabled him to do, whether or not he should venture to follow. It was a
      knotty point to decide. On the one hand his fears urged him to turn back
      and not risk facing the possible dangers which might lie hidden within
      this mysterious mansion; curiosity, on the other hand, prompted him to
      enter and discover at once and for ever the aim and end of Faust&rsquo;s
      incomprehensible visits. Fear was very near gaining the day, when, in
      thinking over every motive, probable or improbable, which might influence
      the dog, the bright idea flashed across him that perhaps Faust had
      discovered his former master, and the hope of again meeting his &ldquo;dear Mr.
      Arundel&rdquo; outweighing every other consideration, he boldly opened the door,
      and encountering Faust, who had returned to look for him, followed that
      sagacious quadruped up a flight of stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that the particular morning in question was that of the
      fourteenth day from the commencement of Lewis&rsquo;s illness, and the physician
      had pronounced the crisis of the disease to be at hand. He had seen his
      patient late on the previous evening, and administered to him a powerful
      narcotic, from the effect of which he had not recovered when Walter and
      Faust commenced their ramble. Frere, who had sat up with him all night,
      had gone out to refresh himself with a short walk, leaving Lewis under the
      care of Antonelli, his old attendant. This worthy man had in his turn been
      called down to see a friend, who having heard of the Signore Luigi&rsquo;s
      illness, had come to prescribe some outrageous remedy, in the
      infallibility whereof his faith was as unshakable as his ignorance on all
      medical subjects was profound. Antonelli, whose grief at his patron&rsquo;s
      danger had been overpowering, was easily interested in his friend&rsquo;s
      account of the wonderful specific; and with the garrulity of age, he
      remained discussing its merits for a much longer space of time than he was
      at all aware of. Thus it came about that Walter, when he had followed
      Faust upstairs, and after a second fit of hesitation entered an apartment
      through the partially open door of which the dog had disappeared, found
      himself in a room, in one corner of which stood a small iron bedstead
      whereon lay some person, who from his deep, regular breathing seemed to be
      in a sound sleep. Cautiously, and with noiseless footsteps, the boy
      approached and gazed upon the sleeper, nor, for a moment, could he
      recognise, in the pale, worn face which met his view, the features of his
      &ldquo;dear Mr. Arundel.&rdquo; But this doubt was speedily resolved when Lewis moved
      uneasily in his sleep and muttered some indistinct words, amongst which
      Walter caught the name of Annie. Two clear ideas now presented themselves
      to the boy&rsquo;s mind: his friend was asleep and must not be roused, and from
      the expression of his features he must be either ill or unhappy. Having
      arrived at these conclusions, he proceeded to act upon them by seating
      himself at the bedside, to wait patiently till Lewis should awake, while
      he devoted all the powers of his intellect to form some theory by which to
      account for the change in his late tutor&rsquo;s appearance. As he thus sat
      anxiously watching, Lewis again turned restlessly, murmuring something,
      the meaning of which Walter could not catch, then speaking more
      distinctly, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She leaned upon his arm; she smiled on him; she loves him! I saw it with
      my own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this so plainly, that Walter, fancying he must be awake, addressed
      him, and asked if he were ill. Lewis caught the sound of the words, and
      replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill in mind, Frere, nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter, still believing him to be awake, continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I&mdash;Walter; do you not know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the sleeping man made no reply, then resuming the
      conversation which he imagined himself holding with Frere, he exclaimed
      eagerly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love one man and engage herself to another! I tell you no! Annie Grant
      never loved me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Faust (who had been lying quietly, and as if he were quite
      at home, on a rug by the bedside), roused by the sound of his master&rsquo;s
      voice, placed his fore-paws on the bed, and finding himself unnoticed,
      endeavoured to attract attention by licking first the sick man&rsquo;s hand and
      then his face. The effect of the opiate had by this time in a great
      measure worn off, and roused by Faust&rsquo;s intrusive affection, Lewis awoke
      with a violent start, and attempting to raise himself in a sitting
      posture, gazed around him in surprise, then fell back upon his pillow from
      weakness. After lying some moments perfectly motionless, he again unclosed
      his eyes and asked in a low, faint voice, &ldquo;Am I dreaming still, or did I
      see Walter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are awake now, dear Mr. Arundel; it is I, Walter. Faust found you
      out, and brought me to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Walter mentioned Faust, Lewis for the first time perceived his old
      favourite, and stretched out his hand with the intention of patting him,
      but the effort was beyond his strength, and his arm sank powerless by his
      side. Faust, however, perceived the attention, and acknowledged it by
      again licking his hand. Lewis turned his languid eyes from Walter to the
      dog, and a tear stole down his wasted cheek, then his lips grew
      compressed, and an expression of anguish overspread his countenance. With
      consciousness had also returned bitter memories. In the meanwhile Walter,
      delighted at recovering his long-lost friend, grew loquacious in the
      fulness of his joy, and ran on in his usual disconnected manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you haven&rsquo;t forgotten Faust, then, Mr. Arundel? He has never forgotten
      you either, poor fellow! all the time you have been away; but I have taken
      great care of him, you see; he&rsquo;s nice and fat, isn&rsquo;t he? We&rsquo;ve been very
      good friends too, only we used to quarrel sometimes when he would follow
      Annie, and I did not like it because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here he
      paused, having a kind of confused recollection that this was a subject on
      which he wanted to say something particular. After waiting for a minute or
      two his ideas grew in a degree clearer, and he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I took a dislike to poor Annie, because I thought she made you
      go away. I always thought so until she told me it was not the case, and
      how fond she was of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Walter first mentioned Annie&rsquo;s name Lewis started and made a gesture
      to induce him to be silent, but the boy did not understand his wishes, and
      his auditor soon became too much absorbed in the interest of his
      disclosures to seek again to interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were talking about Annie just now, you know, before you were quite
      awake,&rdquo; resumed Walter, &ldquo;and you said she did not love you. I remember I
      thought so too once, and that that was the reason why you went away, and
      so I took a dislike to her, and would not let Faust follow her, only he
      would. But we were both quite wrong, for Annie is just as fond of you as
      Faust and I are, and now I&rsquo;ll tell you how I came to find it out.&rdquo; He then
      in his rambling way gave a childish but perfectly intelligible account of
      his conversation with Annie Grant, with which the reader is already
      acquainted. Just as he had finished his recital, Richard Frere returned
      from his walk in time to overhear the last few words of the history, and
      to discover that Lewis had fainted from intense emotion.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>alter&rsquo;s visit to
      Lewis produced a more favourable effect upon the patient&rsquo;s health than did
      all the pills and potions wherewith his doctor had sought to exorcise the
      fever-fiend. He had <i>not</i> then deceived himself&mdash;Annie <i>had</i>
      loved him; nay, from Walter&rsquo;s recital, as well as from her manner on the
      occasion of his protecting her through the crowd in the square of St.
      Mark, was he not justified in believing that she loved him still? The idea
      was in itself happiness, for although the fact of her renewing her
      engagement with Lord Bellefield so immediately after Lewis had quitted
      Broadhurst still remained unaccounted for, the belief that she loved him
      seemed to impart a new aspect to the whole affair, and for the first time
      he allowed himself to hope that her conduct might admit of some
      satisfactory explanation. The emotions of a mind so impulsive as Lewis&rsquo;s
      necessarily produce marked effects upon the body; agitation of spirits had
      mainly conduced to bring on the fever which had thus prostrated, him, and
      the hope to which Walter&rsquo;s words had given rise seemed to infuse new life
      into him; at all events, it is certain that from the moment in which he
      became convinced that Annie had loved him he began to amend. As soon as
      Frere considered him strong enough to bear such an announcement, he
      informed him of the appalling fate which had overtaken his enemy. Lewis
      was at first strongly affected. But for events over which he had had no
      control he might now have been in the position of Miles Hardy, a wanderer
      on the face of the earth, bearing with him the harrowing consciousness
      that the blood of a fellow-creature was upon his hands. After remaining in
      silent thought for some minutes he suddenly raised his eyes to his
      friend&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frere,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how can I ever be sufficiently grateful to God, who
      chose you as His instrument to set my sin before me, and bring me to a
      better frame of mind! Had this dreadful fate overtaken Bellefield without
      my having resolved not to fight him, I should have felt morally guilty of
      his death, considering that it was mere accident which had enabled Hardy
      to meet him sooner than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You acted rightly, under circumstances which I must confess to have
      afforded about as severe a trial to a man of your impetuous nature as
      could well be conceived,&rdquo; returned Frere; &ldquo;so it is but fair that you
      should reap some advantage from your self-conquest. I pity poor young
      Hardy more than I blame him, for he has probably never been taught the
      truths of Christianity, and nothing else could have possessed sufficient
      power over him to induce him to forego his revenge. Ah! if such men as
      Bellefield could but be made to see the mental agony their vices cause to
      others, even their selfish hearts would be touched, and they would be
      unable to go on sinning with such callous indifference; but in their
      selfishness they look merely to the gratification of their own passions,
      and ignore all possible results which might tend to interfere with them.
      Such a career as Bellefield&rsquo;s is a fearful and inexplicable mystery to
      reflect upon, and it is only by a high exercise of faith that we can
      believe even Omnipotence able to bring good out of such consistent and
      unmitigated wickedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is such your belief?&rdquo; inquired Lewis earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly it is,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I am not one of those who
      acknowledge God&rsquo;s attributes with my tongue but in my heart practically
      deny; nor can I believe that a Being, the perfection of wisdom, of
      justice, and of mercy, could allow evil to exist, were He not able to
      overrule it to good. But if you ask me, &lsquo;How can these things be?&rsquo; I tell
      you at once I do not know; I form no theory on the subject, for I have no
      power to do so; my mind is that of a weak, fallen man, and the secret
      things of God are so immeasurably above it that to speculate upon them is
      equally presumptuous and absurd. Still I feel as certain of the main fact
      as if each special detail of the Divine scheme lay spread out like a map
      before me, because, were it not so, God would falsify His attributes; the
      great Being we worship would be, not a merciful Father, but a stern,
      inexorable judge. Depend upon it, Lewis, the real fallacy in the religious
      teaching of the present day is that, practically if not theoretically,
      fear rather than love is inculcated as the actuating principle, and, as a
      natural consequence, men ignore and put aside thoughts of futurity as they
      put aside any other painful and alarming reflection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Frere concluded Lewis paused in thought, then observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you have said sounds wise and true, and yet there appears a
      contradiction somewhere. Evil must always be hateful to God, and as such
      must deserve everlasting punishment. I cannot understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I wish or expect you to do so,&rdquo; replied Frere; &ldquo;but cannot you
      wait patiently through a little space&mdash;the life of one man&mdash;trusting
      that when this mortal shall have put on immortality our enlarged faculties
      may enable us to see clearly that which we now believe as a matter of
      faith? The only difficulty arises from your attempting to measure things
      infinite with your finite intelligence; for instance, you talk of
      everlasting punishment&mdash;what do you mean by the term?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean, why, of course, punishment that shall endure throughout eternity,&rdquo;
       replied Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And eternity, which to be eternal can no more have had a beginning than
      it shall have an end, is an idea our minds cannot grasp; and in attempting
      to define and realise these things we only confuse and mislead ourselves.
      Take my word for it, Lewis, true religion, the religion Christ came down
      from heaven to teach men, consists in a sincere, earnest, and consistent
      belief in the goodness and benevolence of the Creator, carried out
      practically by an unceasing endeavour to reform our fallen natures after
      His image.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are we to gain the knowledge and the strength requisite to enable
      us to do this?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By studying God&rsquo;s written word with an honest intention of doing as we
      are there told to do, at the same time imploring His assistance to enable
      us to carry out our good intentions,&rdquo; was the earnest reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the conversation ended; but Lewis thought over the ideas thus presented
      to him, which, though not entirely new to him, or indeed to any other
      reflecting mind, had perhaps never before occurred in a light so clear and
      practical as that in which Frere had placed them; and as by slow degrees
      his strength began to return, and with Antonelli&rsquo;s assistance he contrived
      to creep for an hour at a time to his painting-room, he arose from that
      couch of sickness a wiser and a better man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Charles Leicester had recovered from the first shock of his
      brother&rsquo;s death he determined to entrust his wife and child to the care of
      General Grant, while he started for England to break the distressing
      intelligence to his father. Lord Ashford was now becoming an old man, and
      although the profligate career of his eldest son had caused him the
      deepest anxiety and regret, he still regarded him with much affection; and
      Leicester had only too good reason to dread the effect which might be
      produced upon him if, by any accident, he were to become aware of the
      fatal event without sufficient preparation. Accordingly, on the second day
      after the discovery of the catastrophe, he quitted Venice, and travelled
      day and night till he reached England; but fast as he journeyed, the evil
      tidings journeyed still more swiftly: a rumour of the truth had somehow
      found its way to the London clubs; at one to which he belonged Lord
      Ashford had accidentally overheard the affair discussed, and while
      uttering a half-frantic inquiry in regard to the speaker&rsquo;s authority, was
      seized with a fit, from which he recovered only to remain a heart-broken
      man, paralysed and childish. Charles finding him in this deplorable state,
      was of course unable to leave him, and wrote to Laura to beg that no
      unnecessary delay might occur to prevent her joining him as soon as
      possible. Under these circumstances, General Grant resolved to proceed to
      England at once, with the party under his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Frere&rsquo;s anxiety for Lewis&rsquo;s life had ended, and he felt satisfied
      that he was on the road towards recovery, and might safely be entrusted to
      the care of Antonelli, he had made his way to the Palazzo Grassini, and
      seeking an interview with General Grant, had explained to him the object
      which had brought him to Venice, together with the train of events which
      had hitherto prevented his announcing his arrival. He also gave an account
      of the <i>fracas</i> between Lord Belle-field and Lewis at the Casino, and
      his friend&rsquo;s subsequent self-conquest, in resolving for conscience&rsquo; sake
      to forego his revenge; but he said nothing of Lewis&rsquo;s attachment to Annie,
      feeling that he had no right to betray his confidence to the General
      without obtaining his consent to the measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant was much interested by this recital, and highly extolled
      Lewis&rsquo;s conduct throughout the whole affair, the shock of Lord
      Bellefield&rsquo;s death having taken away any little prejudices in favour of
      duelling which might have lingered in the chivalrous mind of the old
      soldier. He thought, however, that considering the relative positions of
      the different parties, it would be better for him not to visit Lewis so
      soon after the awful catastrophe which had taken place, but he sent him a
      kind message by Frere, saying he should hope to see him on his return to
      England, and thanking him for his interference in Walter&rsquo;s behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning previous to that fixed for the departure of Laura and her
      friends, Lewis, having over-exerted himself the day before by painting for
      several hours, and having paid the penalty by lying awake during great
      part of the night, had fallen into a deep sleep, which lasted so long,
      that Frere, having breakfasted and given orders that Lewis was on no
      account to be disturbed, went out. He had undertaken, with his usual good
      nature, innumerable commissions for the General; these he set to work
      diligently to execute, and after wandering up and down the lanes and
      squares of Venice, now trudging like an excited postman, now sitting bolt
      upright in the stern of a gondola, with <i>the</i> cotton umbrella spread
      like a gigantic mushroom over his head to keep off the sun, he arrived,
      hot and tired, at the Palazzo Grassini. General Grant was from home, so
      Frere left a card, saying he would call later in the afternoon; then,
      considering on second thoughts that it would not be kind, as he had been
      out so long, to leave Lewis again on the same day, he altered his
      determination, and desiring to be shown into the library, sent a message
      to ask to be allowed to speak to Mrs. Leicester, or to Miss Grant. Now the
      servant to whom this message was entrusted, being, like many of his
      betters, averse to needless trouble, and chancing to encounter Annie as he
      was proceeding from the library to the drawing-room, saw fit slightly to
      alter the tenor of his message, and leaving out all mention of Laura,
      informed Miss Grant that a gentleman of the name of Frere, having called
      to visit the General, had, on learning that he was from home, asked to be
      allowed to see her. This intelligence rather flurried Annie, Frere being
      always connected in her mind with the idea of Lewis, and it was not
      without a degree of trepidation, which mantled her cheek with a most
      becoming blush, that she hastened to comply with his summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Frere perceived who it was that his message had produced, a scheme,
      which had suggested itself to him as a vague possibility, as he had sat by
      Lewis&rsquo;s bedside listening to the ravings of his delirium, recurred to his
      mind, as a right and advisable step which it behoved him to take, now that
      chance had thrown the opportunity in his way; his first business, however,
      was to deliver himself of the commissions entrusted to him by the General.
      Having relieved his mind of the weight of this responsibility, he began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Grant, I&rsquo;m glad to see you looking better than you were. I
      suppose it&rsquo;s the&rdquo;&mdash;(having got rid of your detestable engagement was
      his original sentence, but he checked himself, and substituted)&mdash;&ldquo;idea
      of getting away from this horrid place, all puddles and palaces; the men
      every one of them either a tyrant or a slave, and such lazy rascals into
      the bargain; the women, not at all the style of female to talk to you
      about; and without any particular beauty to account for it either, as far
      as I&rsquo;m a judge, though perhaps in my present position I&rsquo;m a little bit
      over fastidious; but then Rose Arundel is as near perfection as anything
      on this earth can be&mdash;however, I&rsquo;m forgetting you don&rsquo;t know anything
      of the matter, and all that I&rsquo;m saying must be high Dutch, or thereabouts,
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And having by this time talked himself into a regular entanglement, the
      worthy bear came to a sudden and unexpected standstill. Annie hastened to
      relieve him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, indeed, let me into a secret, Mr. Frere,&rdquo; she said, smiling;
      &ldquo;but it is quite safe in my hands, and it is a secret, moreover, which I
      am delighted to hear: there is no one in whose happiness I take deeper
      interest than in that of dear Rose Arundel, and I quite approve of the
      step you hint at as being likely to secure it. You must allow me to offer
      you my warmest congratulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye, thank ye,&rdquo; returned Frere, looking most comically bashful, and
      routing his hair about insanely in his embarrassment, &ldquo;I certainly do hope
      to make her happy, God bless her; though I don&rsquo;t think you can judge much
      about it one way or other, seeing that I may be a Bear in reality (she
      calls me one in fun, you know), meaning to eat her up bodily for aught you
      can tell. As to its being much of a secret, too many people know it, too
      many women in particular, to render that possible; so, though I don&rsquo;t want
      it announced in the <i>Times</i> till the event actually comes off, you
      need not put any violent constraint upon your natural communicativeness,
      for I am not so ignorant of the idiosyncrasies of the fair sex as to
      forget the pain and grief constrained silence occasions them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie made a playful rejoinder, and then, after a minute&rsquo;s pause, ventured
      timidly to ask, &ldquo;I hope Mr. Arundel continues to gain strength. I&mdash;that
      is my father&mdash;and indeed all of us were so grieved to hear of his
      illness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere fixed his large eyes upon her as he replied gruffly, &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s
      getting on well enough for anything I know to the contrary; but he&rsquo;s as
      weak as a child. It will be months before he becomes anything like the man
      he was; he&rsquo;s been unpleasantly near supplying a vacancy in some moist
      graveyard of this amphibious city; small thanks to those who helped to
      bring him to such a condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie turned very pale at this somewhat unfeeling speech, but she managed
      to stammer out, &ldquo;I thought, that is, we were told that it was a fever,
      produced by exposure to malaria, from which Mr. Arundel had suffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fever it was, and no mistake,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;such a fever as I should
      be very sorry to fall in the way of catching, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you have nursed him through it with the most unceasing
      self-devotion. You see I know you better than you are aware of, Mr.
      Frere,&rdquo; interrupted Annie with a beaming smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse him! why, of course I did; if I hadn&rsquo;t, I should have deserved to
      be well kicked,&rdquo; returned Frere in a tone of intense disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known
      Lewis ever since he was a pretty black-eyed boy of ten years old, and
      though he is a little hot-headed and impetuous sometimes, that&rsquo;s no reason
      why I should leave him to die of a fever in a foreign land, far away from
      those that care about him. A nice sort of friend I should be if I did, and
      a pretty figure I should cut the next time I came in Rose&rsquo;s way! She is
      not one of those who love people by halves, I can tell you; why, she
      actually dotes on her brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sure she does; it was that which first made me love her,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Annie with enthusiasm; then seeing all that her speech involved,
      she blushed &ldquo;celestial rosy red&rdquo; and cast down her eyes in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Frere, &ldquo;that sounds all very nice and amiable, but I
      prefer deeds to words! I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Miss Grant,&rdquo; he
      continued, turning suddenly upon Annie, &ldquo;you talked about malaria being
      the exciting cause of Lewis&rsquo;s illness, it was no such thing&mdash;the
      cause of his fever was anguish of mind&mdash;the poor boy&rsquo;s been miserable
      for the last two years, almost crazy with grief, as I take it, for he has
      been doing all sorts of wild, unreasonable things; and if the truth must
      be told, it strikes me it&rsquo;s more your fault than any one else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fault!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie, her face and neck flushing crimson at this
      unexpected charge. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Frere, how can you speak such cruel words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they happen to be true ones, young lady,&rdquo; returned Frere sternly.
      &ldquo;You are the daughter of a rich man, and a man in a high station, and for
      that reason it&rsquo;s very seldom you have the plain, honest truth spoken to
      you; but you shall learn it to-day from my lips, if you never heard it
      before in your life, and if it is not palatable, the fault does not rest
      with me. I knew something of this same affair when Lewis quitted
      Broadhurst all in a hurry, two years ago, and I set it down as a foolish
      bit of boyish romance, which a few months&rsquo; absence would cure; but it was
      not till I watched by his bedside, and listened through the solemn hours
      of the night to his frenzied ravings, that I became aware the passion he
      felt for you was rooted in his very heart&rsquo;s core, and saw that by his
      deep, his overpowering love for one who I fear was not worthy of him, he
      had shipwrecked the happiness of a lifetime. Silence!&rdquo; he continued
      angrily, as Annie, half rising from her seat, seemed about to interrupt
      him, &ldquo;silence! you have voluntarily, or involuntarily, been the cause of
      deep misery to the two persons (for Rose has suffered greatly on her
      brother&rsquo;s account) for whom I care most in the world, and you shall learn
      before we part the evil consequences of your acts, and tell me whether you
      possess either the will or the power to repair them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie again attempted to speak, but finding her accuser would not listen
      to her, sunk back with a gesture of despair, while Frere continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very early in his residence at Broadhurst, Lewis, as I imagine, became
      attached to you, though for a long time he would not acknowledge the fact
      even to himself: at length, however, self-deception became impossible;
      then began the struggle between his pride and his affection; and from that
      period to the hour in which he quitted Broadhurst he lived in a state of
      mental torture. Well, you could not help his falling in love with you, you
      will say; and because a poor tutor was bold and foolish enough to forget
      the difference of position between you (which, by the way, he never did
      for one moment, though the recollection was agony to his proud spirit),
      and to raise his eyes to his employer&rsquo;s daughter, you were not bound to
      forget it also&mdash;I grant you that&mdash;but shall I tell you what you
      could have helped? (which I should never have known anything about but for
      poor Lewis&rsquo;s delirious ravings)&mdash;you could have helped saying and
      doing a hundred little nameless things, trifles in themselves perhaps (so
      are straws, but they show which way the wind blows!), things which gave
      the poor fellow the idea that you returned his affection, and that had he
      dared to declare his feelings, he might have obtained such a confession
      from you; an attempt which he was far too honourable to make, but rather,
      with an aching heart, tore himself away from Broadhurst, throwing up every
      prospect he then had in life: you might have helped this, Miss Annie
      Grant, and if you had been worthy of the love of such a noble nature you
      would have done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Frere, completely carried away by the excited feelings which his
      recapitulation of Lewis&rsquo;s wrongs and sufferings had aroused, paused for
      breath, poor Annie, who during the latter portion of his harangue had been
      utterly unable to restrain her tears, replied in a voice scarcely audible
      through emotion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cruelly misjudge me, Mr. Frere&mdash;most cruelly&mdash;and are
      making an unkind and ungenerous use of knowledge which, if your friend had
      retained his reason, would never have been in your possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere felt the justice of this reproach, and moreover the sight of poor
      Annie&rsquo;s tears appealed to his kindness of heart, and served to disarm his
      wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is certainly true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if I have indeed misjudged
      you, why I can only say I am very sorry for it; at all events I need not
      have spoken so harshly and rudely to you; but you see, Miss Grant, I feel
      very deeply about this matter, and the idea that all which Lewis has
      suffered had been the consequence of your love of admiration and idle
      coquetry made me angry with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, indeed, I am no coquette,&rdquo; murmured poor Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you seem to have behaved like one, at all events,&rdquo; returned Frere;
      &ldquo;unless, indeed,&rdquo; he continued, as a new light suddenly broke in upon him&mdash;&ldquo;unless,
      indeed, you really do by any chance care about Lewis as much as he cares
      about you&mdash;of course in that event you would be more to be pitied
      than blamed.&rdquo; He paused, then after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, continued, &ldquo;But
      no, that cannot be either; if you had really loved Lewis, you would
      scarcely have engaged yourself to another man before he had been out of
      the house four-and-twenty hours. What do you say to that? eh, young lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Annie! heavily indeed did her fault press upon her; most bitterly did
      she repent the weakness of character which had prevented her from refusing
      to engage her hand when her heart went not with it. What could she say?
      Why, she could only sob like an unhappy child, and whisper in a broken
      voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send Laura to you&mdash;ask her, she knows all&mdash;she can tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so running out of the room, she threw herself upon her friend&rsquo;s neck,
      and begged her, incoherently and vaguely, to &ldquo;go immediately to <i>him</i>
      and explain <i>everything</i>;&rdquo; with which request Laura, when she had
      provided the solitary pronoun with a chaperon in the shape of a concordant
      noun, and restricted the transcendental &ldquo;everything&rdquo; to mean the one thing
      needful in that particular case, hastened to comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commission was rather a delicate one, and the excellent Bear did not
      render the execution thereof the less difficult by choosing to take a
      hard-headed, moral, and common-sense view of Annie&rsquo;s conduct, which
      confused Laura to such a degree, that in her desire to be particularly
      lucid, she contrived to entangle the matter so thoroughly that a person
      with greater tact and more delicate perceptions than the rough and
      straightforward Frere might have found the affair puzzling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tell you what it is, Mrs. Leicester,&rdquo; he at last exclaimed
      abruptly, &ldquo;if you were to talk to me till midnight, which, seeing you&rsquo;ve a
      long journey before you to-morrow, would be equally fatiguing and
      injudicious, you would never be able to convince me that your young friend
      acted wisely. The idea of accepting that unhappy man (whose death, between
      ourselves, was a gain to everybody but himself, though, of course, I shall
      not say so to poor Charles, who in his amiability contrived to keep up a
      sort of affection for his brother); but the notion of accepting him to
      prevent anybody guessing she was in love with Lewis seems to me about the
      most feeble-minded expedient that ever occurred to the imagination, even
      of a woman; it&rsquo;s like cutting one&rsquo;s throat to cure a sore finger. I don&rsquo;t
      admire the principle of judging actions by their results, or I should say
      the result of this has been just what I should have expected&mdash;viz.,
      to make everybody miserable. However, though she has done a foolish thing,
      that is very different from doing a deliberately wicked one. Well, I
      suppose we must not be too hard upon her, poor little thing; I dare say
      Lewis, at all events, will be magnanimous enough to overlook it, in
      consideration of her correct taste in properly appreciating his good
      qualities; however, I&rsquo;ll do my best to explain the matter to him, and put
      it in as favourable a light as my conscience will allow me. And so wishing
      you a good journey, I&rsquo;ll be off. I have a notion it won&rsquo;t be very long
      before Lewis and I shall follow you; we shall not be many hours in England
      before we beat up your quarters, depend upon it. Lewis will have some
      strange revelations to make to Governor Grant that will cause his
      venerable locks to stand on end in amazement. Ah! it&rsquo;s a queer world.
      Well, good-bye, Mrs. Leicester: I expect you and I should become good
      friends in time, though you&rsquo;re quite mistaken if you fancy that young
      woman acted sensibly in accepting her scampish cousin, when all the time
      she was in love with another man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus Richard Frere fairly talked himself out of the house, leaving
      Laura especially astonished at his <i>brusquerie</i>, and decidedly of
      opinion that she had mismanaged the affair and done her friend&rsquo;s cause
      irreparable injury.

      CHAPTER LXVII.&mdash;RELATES HOW, THE ECLIPSE BEING OVER, THE SUN BEGAN TO
      SHINE AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the meantime,
      Lewis having awoke from his long sleep, and finding himself all the better
      and stronger for his nap, had just breakfasted with much appetite when
      Antonelli appeared and handed him a note. It was from Laura (written
      before her interview with Frere), informing him of their intended
      departure on the morrow, begging him to call upon her immediately he
      returned to England, which, as soon as his health would permit, she
      advised him to do without loss of time, and winding up with a hint that,
      in regard to the matter which especially interested him, he might make
      himself quite easy, for that everything could be most satisfactorily
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis read and re-read the note. &ldquo;The matter that especially interested
      him!&rdquo;&mdash;that could have but one meaning. Oh, yes I Annie had cleared
      herself&mdash;she had never accepted Lord Bellefield; or, if she had, she
      had been cheated into doing so. Annie was good and true&mdash;the Annie of
      his imagination&mdash;the bright, fair, loving, gentle being his soul
      worshipped! But he must have certainty&mdash;he must not again be the dupe
      of his own wishes; no, he must have certainty, and he must have it at
      once. Wait till his return to England? Why, that might be days, weeks
      hence! And was he all that time to suffer the tortures of suspense? It was
      not to be thought of. He must see Laura before her departure and learn the
      truth. But this would necessitate a visit to the Palazzo Grassini, in
      which he must run the chance of encountering the General or Annie. And as
      his thoughts reverted to her, the idea for the first time occurred to him
      of the mental suffering she must have undergone if, as he now believed,
      she had indeed truly loved him, and been in some unaccountable manner
      forced by circumstances to consent to the engagement with her cousin. Then
      he remembered the scene in the Square of St. Mark, and a sense of the
      cruelty of his own conduct towards her overwhelmed him. This decided the
      question. He would at all risks see Laura; and if&mdash;as he now did not
      for a moment doubt&mdash;her explanation proved satisfactory, he would
      entreat her to obtain Annie&rsquo;s forgiveness. She <i>must</i> forgive him
      when she came to know all he had suffered&mdash;when she heard how ill he
      had been: and as he thought of his illness the somewhat perplexing
      question occurred to him how he was to reach the Palazzo Grassini in his
      present weak state? Never mind; where there was a will there was a way. He
      <i>would</i> do it, he was determined; and so he summoned Antonelli, and
      to the alarm of that worthy man, who fancied the fever had again flown to
      the brain, and that his beloved master was delirious, announced that he
      was going out to pay a visit, and requested his assistance in dressing
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till his toilet was completed and he attempted to walk
      downstairs that he became aware how weak and helpless his illness had left
      him, and it required all his resolution to persevere in his expedition.
      Luckily the distance was short, and he was enabled to perform some part of
      it in a gondola; still, by the time he reached the Palazzo Grassini his
      strength was so completely exhausted that if he had been required to
      proceed a hundred yards further he would have been unable to accomplish
      the task. Having inquired if Mrs. Leicester was at home and received an
      answer in the affirmative, he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then show me up to her boudoir unannounced; I will hold you blameless for
      doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant, who knew how intimate Lewis had been there before the coming
      of the Grant party, and how his visits had ceased with their arrival,
      naturally enough conjectured that the young painter was for some reason
      desirous to avoid encountering any of the General&rsquo;s family, and complied
      with his request unhesitatingly. But the domestic in question, who chanced
      to be the same individual who had admitted Frere, was not aware of the
      additional and, to the parties concerned, somewhat important fact, that
      since he had performed that service Miss Grant and his mistress had
      changed places, and that at the moment he was conducting Lewis to the
      boudoir that apartment was tenanted by Annie Grant, while Laura was
      engaged in solemn conclave with Richard Frere in the library. Thus it fell
      out that when the door of the boudoir was noiselessly opened, Annie Grant,
      who had remained there after she had despatched Laura on her difficult
      mission to Ursa Major, and <i>more majorum</i>, from the time of Niobe
      downwards, had indulged her feelings with a hearty cry, was wiping her
      eyes and trying to make herself believe that her troubles must be &ldquo;working
      to an end,&rdquo; and that dim on the horizon of her future fate there might be
      discerned a good time coming. Annie thus pondering, and thus engaged, saw
      a tall, bending figure enter, in whose well-known features, their
      expression softened and spiritualised by severe illness, she needed no
      announcement to recognise Lewis Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows of Laura&rsquo;s boudoir were shaded from the burning rays of an
      Italian sun by (literally) Venetian blinds, which kept out not only the
      heat, but in great measure the light also; and Lewis, whose eyes were
      dizzy and his head swimming from weakness, perceiving a female figure
      advancing towards him, naturally conjectured it to be Laura, and accosted
      her as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no doubt surprised to see me here, but after perusing your note I
      could not rest till I had learned the truth from your own lips, and as you
      are to quit Venice to-morrow, there was no time to lose; so I resolved, <i>coûte
      qui coûte</i>, to make the effort, and here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a reply, but obtaining none, looked up in surprise, and
      perceived Annie Grant standing pale and trembling before him. Completely
      overcome by this unexpected encounter, he contrived to stammer out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, I believed I was addressing Mrs. Leicester. I must go and
      seek her,&rdquo; and turned to put his design into execution; but his strength
      was unequal to the task, and leaning against a marble slab, he remained
      motionless, utterly unable to proceed. For a moment Annie paused as if
      thunder-stricken, then her woman&rsquo;s heart awoke within her, and in an
      instant she was by his side, bringing a chair for him to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Arundel, how wrong, how mad of you to venture out,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, her anxiety for him overpowering every other feeling; &ldquo;you will
      bring on a return of the fever. Why, you are so weak that you can scarcely
      stand; pray sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Advancing a step, Lewis took the chair from her, and leaning on the back
      for support, said with a faint smile&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have indeed somewhat miscalculated my strength, Miss Grant; I am very,
      very weak,&rdquo; and as he spoke he sank upon the seat, while the bright flush,
      which the excitement of beholding Annie had called into his cheeks, faded
      to the most deathlike paleness: his companion became alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are faint,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;let me ring for assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tray, with a decanter of water and some glasses, stood upon a table
      near; Lewis&rsquo;s eye fell upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is merely the unaccustomed exertion,&rdquo; he said feebly, &ldquo;it will pass
      away in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie caught the direction of his glance. &ldquo;You would like a glass of
      water,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;let me give you one;&rdquo; and suiting the action to
      the word, she filled a glass with the sparkling liquid and handed it to
      him. He took it with a slight inclination of the head, drank it eagerly,
      and was about to rise, in order to put down the glass, when Annie, by a
      deprecating gesture, prevented him, and taking it from his trembling
      fingers replaced it on the table. As she turned from doing so, their eyes
      met, and she perceived that his were fixed on her features with a deep,
      earnest, scrutinising gaze, as though he strove to read in her countenance
      the history of her inner life. For a moment she met his gaze with a
      bright, truthful, unshrinking look; then, unable to bear the power of his
      eagle eye, she turned away with a blush and a smile, half tender, half
      reproachful, for Annie was no stoic, and every feeling of her heart
      revealed itself in her tell-tale countenance. Lewis could bear it no
      longer&mdash;speak he must.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Grant&mdash;Annie,&rdquo; he said, and as he pronounced her Christian name
      his deep voice trembled with suppressed emotion, &ldquo;when I came here to-day
      I had no thought of seeing you; but accident (if, indeed, in this strange,
      complicated life anything may be so considered) has determined it
      otherwise, and the opportunity shall not be lost. Not very many days since
      I was so grievously ill that the chances were strongly against my
      rallying; it has pleased God to spare my life a little longer; but such an
      escape as this gives rise to deep and solemn thoughts. While I lay upon
      the bed of sickness, which had so nearly proved the bed of death, I
      learned to read my own heart&mdash;my past life glided as it were in
      review before me, and my faults and errors, no longer hidden by the mists
      of self-deceit or of passion, revealed themselves clearly in the light of
      an awakened conscience: above them all stood forth in its evil beauty the
      master-demon pride, and I saw how it had embittered my whole existence,
      and how, if ever I hoped to obtain even peace of mind, much more
      happiness, I must relax no effort until I should subdue it. Annie, I have
      loved you long; you cannot, <i>do</i> not doubt it; but because I deemed
      you richer than I was, and of higher rank, I was too proud to own it to
      you. Years of mental torture have been my punishment: I do not complain
      that this should have been so&mdash;I do not impugn the justice of the
      decree; on the contrary, I acknowledge it with deep contrition. I sinned,
      and it was fitting I should pay the penalty, however bitter; but there was
      a grief I was not prepared for, and in which I could not discern
      retributive justice; for whatever a slanderous world may say, my love for
      you has been deep, pure, and disinterested, the truest, most earnest
      feeling of my inmost soul. Annie, I will be frank with you, and even if my
      presumption ruins my cause, I have suffered too much from concealment not
      to tell you the whole truth. When, distracted by my hopeless passion for
      you, and maddened by the insults of one who is now no more, I tore myself
      away from Broadhurst, and left you, as I deemed, for ever, the most bitter
      pang proceeded from a secret belief, which even despair could not banish,
      that I read in your soft glances assurance that had I dared to urge my
      suit, I might have learned I had not loved in vain; and in the midst of my
      desolation I was happy, deeply happy, in the thought. Then a ray of light
      broke in upon the darkness&mdash;a strange chain of events led to the
      discovery that I was heir to an ancient and honourable name and an ample
      fortune, and I waited but to obtain legal evidence of the fact, ere I
      hastened to tell you of my affection, in the fond hope of eliciting that I
      was beloved again: once assured of that, I determined that <i>nothing</i>
      should prevent my winning your hand&mdash;all obstacles must yield before
      such a love as mine. With these feelings burning in my breast, imagine the
      dismay which overwhelmed me on learning by a letter from your father that
      scarcely twenty-four hours after I had quitted Broadhurst, you, of your
      own free will, had renewed your engagement with your cousin. Hear me out,&rdquo;
       he continued, as Annie, who with blushing cheeks and tearful eyes, had
      remained as though spell-bound, drinking in his every tone, attempted
      eagerly to interrupt him&mdash;&ldquo;hear me out, and then if you can explain
      this mystery, the devotion of a life-time shall plead forgiveness for my
      having misjudged you. How I lived through the wretchedness that letter
      caused me, I do not know. I believed I was going mad, for a time I <i>was</i>
      mad, and railed at Heaven for having created a being so fair and false as
      then I deemed you. Oh! the misery, the heavy, crushing grief, when the
      heart adores, with all its faculty of loving, one whom the reason points
      out as light, fickle, and all unworthy to have called forth such true
      affection. For two years this black veil of doubt and mistrust hung
      between your image and my spirit&mdash;I cast from me any idea of claiming
      the rank and riches that were my birthright, for I valued them only as
      they could bring me nearer to you; and went forth a wanderer, tormented by
      the consciousness, doubly humiliating to one of my proud nature, that
      although I believed you unworthy of my affection, I still loved you
      devotedly as ever. The first person who won me from my gloomy thoughts,
      and led me to hope your conduct might be satisfactorily explained, was
      your kind friend Laura, who in her honest singleness of heart could not
      believe in the possibility of the fickleness of which I imagined you.
      guilty&mdash;and I (though her arguments failed to convince my reason),
      how I loved her for her unbelief! I could say much more&mdash;could tell
      you of the agony of mind I endured, when unseen by you I watched you
      leaning on <i>his</i> arm and smiling upon him, and deemed my worst fears
      realised, and that you loved him; but it is needless&mdash;Annie, I cannot
      look on you and believe you false; if indeed you ever loved me, I <i>know</i>
      that, despite appearances, you have been true to that affection, and that
      you love me still. Annie, dearest, tell me that it is so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased, and with his hands clasped, as those of some votary adoring his
      saint, sat gazing on the April of smiles and tears that played over the
      expressive features of her he loved, until reading in her tender glances
      the secret her lips refused to speak, happiness lent him strength, and
      springing to her side, he drew her unresistingly towards him, and reproved
      the coral lips for their silence by sealing his forgiveness upon them with
      a loving kiss. And as Annie, albeit there is no reason to doubt that she
      was an exceedingly moral and well-conducted young lady, did not appear to
      discern any great impropriety in this act, but, on the contrary,
      disengaged herself from his embrace gently and tenderly, the probabilities
      are, looking at the matter in a correct light, and with an artist eye (an
      optical delusion, popularly supposed to fulfil one of the main duties of
      charity by clothing the naked), that the view she took of the affair was a
      right one. And then by degrees, having declared that it was impossible she
      could ever tell him anything about it, but that Laura knew&mdash;would not
      he go and ask Laura at once? (a proposition Lewis coolly but decidedly
      rejected), she contrived, she never knew how, to enable him to guess the
      truth, which he did very quickly and cleverly, and found so perfectly
      satisfactory that his anger (such mild anger!) instantly changed to the
      most unmitigated pity, an emotion so nearly akin to that other Christian
      virtue, love, that we fear we shall lay ourselves open to the charge of
      writing an actual love scene if we pursue the subject any further. And as
      it is a well-ascertained fact that young persons strictly brought up and
      never allowed to inflame their imaginations and gain perverted views of
      life by perusing those inventions of the enemy of man- (and woman-) kind,
      works of fiction, either never fall in love at all or do so according to
      parental act of parliament, passed in the year one of the reign of good
      king Mammon, we (lest we incur the high displeasure of any of this
      monarch&rsquo;s respectable subjects) will say no more about it. But when Laura,
      grieved at what she considered the unsatisfactory issue of her interview
      with Richard Frere, returned to her boudoir to make the best report her
      conscience would allow of to Annie, she was especially surprised, and a
      little frightened, to discover her friend, with heightened colour,
      downcast eyes, and a bright smile playing about the corners of her mouth,
      sitting on a sofa by the side of what Laura would have taken for the ghost
      of Lewis Arundel, only that ghosts do not in a general way look intensely
      happy, and are not usually addicted to holding young ladies&rsquo; hands
      caressingly between their spectral fingers. However, the ghost soon
      vindicated his claim to the protection of the Habeas Corpus Act by rising
      and shaking Laura&rsquo;s hand cordially, and taking the initiative in
      conversation by exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, kind Mrs. Leicester, I owe all my happiness to you.&rdquo; Then Laura
      began to surmise what had happened, and in the excess of her joy scolded
      Lewis so vigorously for his madness in venturing out, and Annie for her
      folly in allowing him to talk, that she was forced to stop in the midst of
      her harangue to declare herself a virago, and to laugh so heartily at her
      own vehemence that in order to save herself from becoming hysterical she
      was fain to betake herself to her own bedroom and indulge in the feminine
      luxury of a good cry. And then Lewis and Annie sat and looked into each
      other&rsquo;s eyes; their joy was too full for words, but such silence as theirs
      is far more eloquent, for as there is a grief too deep for tears, so is
      there happiness which language is powerless to express, and such happiness
      did they experience at that moment. At length Lewis spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; he said, in a low, soft voice that trembled with the tenderness
      which filled his soul, &ldquo;I must leave you now; there are many reasons which
      forbid my meeting your father till we reach England and I am prepared to
      <i>prove</i> to him all that your trustful, loving heart believes because
      I tell you that it is so. Until we meet in our own happy country, which
      for the future will be as dear to me for your sake as lately it has been
      for the same cause hateful, our engagement must remain a secret from all
      but Laura.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will that be right?&rdquo; pleaded Annie, looking up wistfully into the
      face of him who would be from thenceforth her oracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a fearful responsibility when, through the affections, we gain such
      a hold over a living soul that the judgment lies dormant, and the thing
      which seems good in our eyes appears so in theirs also; such influence is
      indeed a mighty talent committed to our charge, and most careful should we
      be lest we abuse the trust reposed in us. Lewis felt this strongly, and
      paused to reconsider his decision. His chief reason for wishing that
      General Grant might not be immediately informed of his declaration was the
      difficult position in which it would place that gallant officer in regard
      to Lord Bellefield&rsquo;s relations. How could he, for instance, expect Lord
      Ashford to believe that his brother-in-law had used all possible exertion
      to secure the murderer of his son when Annie Grant, that son&rsquo;s destined
      bride, was affianced to a man who, but for the catastrophe which had taken
      place, would have met Lord Bellefield in a duel? the altercation and
      subsequent challenge being so completely a matter of notoriety in Venice
      that it was certain that some account of them, probably an exaggerated and
      distorted one, would find its way to England. But this was a reason which
      he could not give Annie, as he correctly imagined that the affair at the
      Casino had been kept from her knowledge. Thus the more he reflected the
      more certain he became that his original determination was a right one.
      Accordingly he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, dear one; concealment is as foreign to my nature as to your
      own. My faults (and I have only too many) do not lie in that direction;
      but, to the best of my judgment, I believe that in wishing your father
      should, for the present, remain ignorant of our engagement, I am
      consulting your interest and his quite as much as my own. Believe me,
      love, I would sacrifice anything, even the cherished hope of one day
      calling you my own, rather than influence you to do aught for which your
      conscience could afterwards upbraid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Annie did believe him, with the strong, unhesitating faith of perfect
      love. Had he advanced the most incredible assertion&mdash;declared, for
      instance, that he had discovered perpetual motion, squared the circle, and
      set the Thames on fire, Annie would equally and implicitly have believed
      him. Had he deceived her, her only refuge from a universal scepticism
      would have been to die. Then came the &ldquo;sweet sorrow&rdquo; of a lovers&rsquo; parting&mdash;sweet
      in the many evidences of affection which the occasion calls forth, and
      sorrowful by reason of the anxious thoughts to which quitting those we
      love, even under the happiest auspices, necessarily gives rise. Annie&rsquo;s
      bright eyes were dim with tears, and Lewis&rsquo;s mouth, no longer sternly
      compressed, trembled with the emotion he in vain attempted to conceal, as,
      with a murmured &ldquo;God bless and protect you, my own darling!&rdquo; he tore
      himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, scarcely had Richard Frere quitted the Grassini Palace
      than he encountered General Grant, fretting and fuming under the weight of
      a burden of minor miseries, and full of complaints of the abominable
      misdemeanours of the Venetian officials, amongst which, by no means the
      lightest, was the culpable stupidity which prevented them from speaking or
      understanding English, together with the obstinate prejudice with which
      they refused to acknowledge that by adding the letter O to the termination
      of words in that language they immediately became Italian&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said &lsquo;<i>requiro uno passporto</i>&rsquo; to them, sir, half-a-dozen times
      over, and nobody shall ever make me believe they did not know what <i>that</i>
      meant!&rdquo; was his indignant complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Frere&rsquo;s ready sympathy entailed on him a request that if he
      could spare the time to go back to the office with him, the General would
      esteem it such a great favour, and of course, though his conscience
      reproached him for being away from &ldquo;poor, solitary. Lewis&rdquo; for so many
      hours, he did what was required of him; and of course, having said A,&mdash;B,
      C, and D followed as a matter of necessity, until, before he had gone
      through the alphabet of the General&rsquo;s commissions, several hours had
      elapsed, and Lewis, having found his way back to his lodgings, was
      reclining in an easy-chair enjoying a feast of happy memories and bright
      anticipations, when Frere, hot, tired, and dissatisfied with his morning&rsquo;s
      work, flung down his cotton umbrella, and throwing himself, very much
      unbuttoned, in a kind of dishevelled heap upon the nearest chair, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, confound this climate, say I, where a man can&rsquo;t get through a
      morning&rsquo;s business without coming home more like a piece of hot boiled
      beef than a temperate Christian&mdash;here&rsquo;s a state of dissolution for a
      free-born Briton to be in. I tell you what it is, young man, if you keep
      me here much longer I shall become a mere walking skeleton&mdash;flesh and
      blood literally can&rsquo;t stand it, and I shall have to go home and be married
      in my bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By which ceremony I suppose you hope to become possessed of an additional
      rib to make up for your loss of substance,&rdquo; suggested Lewis, smiling at
      the odd, quaint way in which his friend described his troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all very well for you to sit there and laugh at a fellow,&rdquo;
       returned Frere grumpily, &ldquo;but if you had been parading about this oven of
      a place for two hours, tied like a kettle to Governor Grant&rsquo;s tail, as I
      have been, you would find it no such laughing matter, I can tell you. He
      is obstinate and wrong-headed as an elderly mule too, making a fuss about
      trifles that do not signify a bit one way or the other. Why cannot he take
      life coolly and quietly as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he came to an abrupt conclusion, having discovered that the grumbling
      tenor of the speech was somewhat at variance with the ending he had
      intended to make to it&mdash;viz., &ldquo;as I do.&rdquo; Lewis finished it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a sensible man should do, I suppose you were going to observe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frere detected the covert satire and shook his fist threateningly at his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better be civil, you know, or I may be tempted to give you the
      thrashing I have owed you so long. I could not have a better opportunity
      than now, when you are so weak that you can scarcely walk across the room
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I may be stronger than you are aware of,&rdquo; returned Lewis; &ldquo;what
      do you think about my being able to go out, for instance&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think,&rdquo; replied Frere dogmatically; &ldquo;why, I think that if you attempt it
      a week hence it will be too soon. Dr. Grabafee says a fortnight, but his
      is scarcely an unprejudiced opinion; however, I&rsquo;ll take care you don&rsquo;t set
      foot outside this room within a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis turned away to hide a smile, while Frere, still suffering from heat,
      and not having another available button which could be respectably
      unfastened, pulled off his neckcloth, and thus relieved, resumed&mdash;&ldquo;Who
      do you think I have been lecturing this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis professed his ignorance, and Frere continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a certain young lady, in whose proceedings I&rsquo;ve an idea you take
      particular interest&mdash;one Miss Annie Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis started as Frere pronounced this name, but recovering himself, asked
      in an elaborately indifferent tone of voice, &ldquo;Pray when did this
      interesting colloquy take place, and what might be the subject thereof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The colloquy, as you call it, took place some four hours ago; and the
      subject thereof was the young woman&rsquo;s conduct towards your precious self.
      Now, don&rsquo;t go and fly into a passion,&rdquo; continued Frere, as Lewis coloured
      and seemed about to make some hasty rejoinder; &ldquo;remember, life ought to be
      taken easily and quietly by a sensible man, and of course you consider
      yourself one: however, I took the liberty to tell Miss General Grant a few
      home truths that she will be none the worse for hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then proceeded, after his own fashion, to give an account of his
      conversation with Annie, and his subsequent interview with Laura,
      concluding his recital thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the upshot of the whole affair, and a very unsatisfactory one I&rsquo;m
      afraid you&rsquo;ll think it, is this. When you had left Broadhurst, Ma&rsquo;amselle
      Annie found herself in a bit of a fix, and not being a man or Rose
      Arundel, she, after the fashion of her silly sex, did a weak and
      injudicious thing; but as I said to the other young woman, who, by the
      way, seems to have the best sense of the two, that&rsquo;s very different from
      doing a deliberately wicked one, and therefore, perhaps, Lewis may be
      induced to look over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t tell me any more about it, you
      will drive me frantic with your detestable common-sense platitudes,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Lewis, springing from his chair impatiently; &ldquo;at least you would
      have done so,&rdquo; he continued more quietly, &ldquo;if I had not happened to have
      seen Miss Grant myself since your well-meant but somewhat unnecessary
      interview with her, and learned from her own sweet lips that she forgives
      me for having so hastily and ungenerously misjudged her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! what! has the young woman been here in my absence?&rdquo; returned Frere,
      greatly scandalised. &ldquo;Oh! this will never do! I don&rsquo;t allow such liberties
      to be taken with my patient; besides, I don&rsquo;t consider the proceeding by
      any means a correct one; she might have found you in bed, with your
      nightcap on, for aught she could tell to the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what is reported to have occurred when a mountain objected to
      come at Mahomet&rsquo;s bidding?&rdquo; asked Lewis quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mahomet went to the mountain, to be sure, like an arrant humbug as
      he was; but what has that got to do with the case in question? Why, you
      don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; continued Frere, as a sudden light broke in upon him&mdash;&ldquo;you
      don&rsquo;t mean to say that <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> been to call upon <i>her?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I must confess that such is the alarming fact,&rdquo; was the cool
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I have known many insane actions in my life, certainly,&rdquo; growled
      Frere, making fruitless attempts to re-unbutton his already enfranchised
      garments, &ldquo;but this&rdquo;&mdash;here he nearly tore a wristband off his shirt
      in his pursuit of coolness under difficulties&mdash;&ldquo;is the very maddest
      thing I ever did hear of&mdash;a man that was on the point of death here
      not ten days ago to rush out of bed the moment one&rsquo;s back is turned for
      the sake of seeing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is looking so sweetly pretty, Frere,&rdquo; interrupted Lewis; &ldquo;and those
      eyes&mdash;there never were such eyes seen in the world before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course not,&rdquo; returned Frere viciously. &ldquo;Patent double-actioned,
      high-pressure, sky-blue revolvers, made to look every way at once, see
      through mill-stones, and peep round the corner into the bargain, <i>they</i>
      are, no doubt; but if she could use them to no better purpose than to lure
      out, at the risk of his life, a foolish boy that ought to have had more
      sense&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a mere waste of words talking to you,&rdquo; he continued,
      catching a smile on Lewis&rsquo;s features; &ldquo;and here have I gone and ruined my
      other shirt, and this one is at the wash&mdash;psha! I mean to say, ruined
      my other wash&mdash;that is, washed my other ruin&mdash;hang me if I know
      what I mean to say&mdash;only if you&rsquo;re not the worse for this&mdash;bother
      the boy, how absurdly happy he&rsquo;s looking! So it&rsquo;s all right between you,
      eh! Lewis? Well, Heaven knows, you have suffered enough to deserve that it
      should be so, my poor fellow, and though you must have been mad to go out,
      and I ought to be very angry with you, yet, as it has ended, and always
      supposing it does not do you any harm, why I am heartily glad you did it;&rdquo;
       and so saying, Frere, whose feelings, and the heat together, were
      decidedly too many for him, made a precipitate retreat into the bedroom,
      where, for the present, we will leave him.

      CHAPTER LXVIII.&mdash;LEWIS OUT-GENERALS THE GENERAL, AND THE TRAIN STOPS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ewis&rsquo;s recovery
      was not retarded by his imprudent visit to the Palazzo Grassini; and Frere
      had the satisfaction, ere many weeks elapsed, of perceiving that he was
      strong enough to render their return to England practicable. Accordingly,
      the &ldquo;Giaour&rdquo; pictures and the sketch of Annie and Faust were carefully
      packed (Lewis having determined to retain them as mementos of the eventful
      portion of his career which led to their execution), old Antonelli
      received a present of money sufficient to enable him to carry out the
      darling wish of his heart&mdash;viz., to bestow upon his son the education
      of a painter; and Lewis and Frere, having wound up their affairs in
      Venice, quitted that city, which, filled with a rabble of revolutionary
      demagogues and their dupes, had become no longer a desirable place of
      residence. The friends reached England without any adventures worthy of
      record; and Rose was compensated for many a weary hour of anxiety and
      suspense by her joy in welcoming her brother, and learning from his lips
      the unmitigated satisfaction with which he had heard of her engagement to
      Richard Frere; and how that &ldquo;glorious fellow&rdquo; had redoubled all his former
      obligations to him by his sound advice and tender and judicious nursing.
      If for a moment Frere could have regretted the part he had played, the
      loving smile of warm approval with which Rose received him would have
      compensated him for any far greater expenditure of time and trouble. But
      Lewis had much to tell, which gave rise to very different emotions in his
      auditor; and Rose, as she grieved for the untimely fate of poor Jane
      Hardy, and shuddered at the awful retribution which had overtaken her
      betrayer, breathed a silent thanksgiving that her brother had been
      restrained from any deed of violence, to which his impetuous disposition,
      keen sensibilities, and quick sense of injury might have impelled him.
      Lewis had also something to hear as well as to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arundel, in her spirit of opposition to the artless and bereaved
      relict of the late Colonel Brahmin, had carried her flirtation with that
      victim of literary ambition, Dackerel Dace, Esq., to such a pitch, that
      when the blighted barrister determined to resign his destiny altogether in
      favour of matrimony, and made her an offer of his limp hand, flabby heart,
      and five thousand a year to give piquancy and flavour to the tasteless and
      insipid &ldquo;trifle&rdquo; he <i>tendered</i> for her acceptance, that volatile
      matron felt that she had committed herself too deeply to retract, and
      that, setting off the money against the man, the bargain after all might
      not be such a bad one, and so said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Rose disliked the match greatly,
      and fearing Lewis would do so still more strongly, ventured upon a mild
      remonstrance; but when once she had taken a thing into her head, Mrs.
      Arundel was very determined, and Rose gained nothing but an intimation,
      half earnest, half playful, that as she (Mrs. Arundel) had not interfered
      with her daughter when she chose to engage herself to Ursa Major, she
      expected the same for<i>bear</i>ance (and she emphasised the vile pun most
      unmistakably) to be exercised towards her and her odd fish, by which
      nickname she irreverently paraphrased the ichthyological appellation of
      her &ldquo;<i>future</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis, as Rose had feared, was both hurt and annoyed at this fresh and
      convincing proof of his mother&rsquo;s volatile and worldly nature, but there
      was nothing in the connection to justify his taking measures to break off
      the match; Mrs. Arundel was perfectly free to do as she pleased, and
      competent to decide her own course in life; so after one conversation with
      her on the subject, the nature of which may be gathered from the result,
      he left the affair to take its own course. His first step on reaching
      London was to seek an interview with his legal adviser; their conference
      proving satisfactory, eventuated (to use an affected but expressive word)
      in sending for a patent cab, wherein Lewis ensconced himself, in company
      with a small lawyer and a large blue bag, and the trio drove to Park
      Crescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feelings with which Lewis once again stood within the library of
      General Grant&rsquo;s mansion&mdash;that library where he had first been engaged
      to act as poor Walter&rsquo;s tutor&mdash;the chamber into which he and Annie
      had been shown on the night when he had rescued her from insult in the
      crush-room of the opera&mdash;the night of the unhappy Mellerton&rsquo;s suicide&mdash;may
      well be imagined. Then he had been poor, friendless, in the situation of a
      dependant, and made to feel that situation, alike by the open insults of
      Lord Bellefield and the frigid courtesy of the General and Miss
      Livingstone, his youth, his inexperience, sensitive disposition, and
      proud, impassioned nature rendering all these trials doubly galling to
      him; while, still more to embitter his lot, came that &ldquo;sorrow&rsquo;s crown of
      sorrow,&rdquo; his hopeless attachment to Annie. Now heir to an ancient and
      honourable name and an ample fortune, his affection returned by her he
      loved, his rival swept from his path without his having to reproach
      himself with participation in the act which wrought his downfall, his mind
      strengthened, his principles raised, and his faults diminished, if not
      eradicated, by the struggle he had undergone, and above all, his soul
      fortified by the recollection that, through God&rsquo;s grace, he had been
      enabled, at the turning-point of his career, to sacrifice everything
      rather than sin against his Maker&rsquo;s law, how different was his position!
      He received a moderately cordial welcome from General Grant, which tepid
      reception was occasioned by a conflict in the mind of that noble
      commander, between his strong regard for Lewis, a sense of the obligations
      he lay under to him, and an uncomfortable recollection of his attachment
      to Annie, together with the moral impossibility of allowing his daughter
      to marry a man whose present income consisted of the savings of an
      ex-tutorship, and whose prospects embraced the doubtful gainings of a
      professional artist; Lewis perceived his embarrassment, and rightly
      conjectured its cause, which it was the object of his visit to remove. But
      General Grant&rsquo;s cold imperturbability had caused him so much annoyance in
      bygone hours, that a slight spice of what the French term <i>esprit malin</i>
      actuated him, and under its influence he began, after a few desultory
      remarks&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may possibly not have escaped your mind, General, that during a
      conversation I had the honour to hold with you before I finally quitted
      Broadhurst, I mentioned to you my devoted attachment to Miss Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General bowed in token of assent, but the cloud upon his brow grew
      darker. Not heeding this, Lewis continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember expressing myself somewhat strongly against certain
      conventional prejudices relating to inequality of position, which opposed
      an effectual bar to the realisation of my wishes. I was young and
      inexperienced then&mdash;I have since become wiser in the ways of the
      world, and am perfectly aware that, in speaking as I did on that occasion,
      I alike wasted my words and your valuable time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused; and the General, who had been considerably puzzled during the
      speech to make out what his companion might be aiming at, settled, to his
      own satisfaction, that the increased knowledge of human nature to which
      Lewis alluded had shown the young man the folly of which he had been
      guilty, and that this speech was intended as an apology&mdash;nothing
      could be more respectful and correct. Accordingly the cloud vanished, as
      in his most gracious manner he replied, &ldquo;Sir, your observations do you
      credit. Pray set your mind at rest on this subject; fortunately my
      daughter never had the slightest suspicion of your feelings towards her;
      and for my own part, I have long ago dismissed the affair from my
      recollection; and you may rest assured that in our future intercourse the
      subject shall never again be broached between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the General alluded to his daughter&rsquo;s happy ignorance of Lewis&rsquo;s
      attachment a slightly ironical smile curled that young gentleman&rsquo;s
      handsome mouth; repressing it instantly, he replied with a calm, almost <i>nonchalant</i>
      air, &ldquo;I scarcely see how that can be accomplished, General Grant, as the
      object of my visit here to-day is to make you a formal proposal for your
      daughter&rsquo;s hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Lewis had suddenly risen from his chair, and with the full power of his
      returning strength had hurled that article of furniture at General Grant&rsquo;s
      head, it might have knocked him down more literally than the foregoing
      speech, but, figuratively, nothing could have done so. For a minute or two
      he appeared utterly unable to frame a reply; then, drawing himself up to a
      degree suggestive of a telescopic conformation, he began in an awful tone
      of voice, &ldquo;Sir, you have astonished me&mdash;nay, more than that, sir, you
      have disappointed me&mdash;very greatly disappointed me. I had hoped
      better things of you, sir; I had hoped, from the early promise you
      evinced, that your judgment and good sense would, when matured and
      strengthened by a little more knowledge of the world, have enabled you to
      conquer your strangely misplaced attachment&mdash;would, in fact, have
      saved me from the painful situation in which you have&mdash;to which you
      have&mdash;that is&mdash;you would have saved yourself (you must not blame
      <i>me</i>, sir, if the truth sounds unpalatable) the humiliation of a
      refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then am I to understand that you unhesitatingly reject my suit?&rdquo; inquired
      Lewis, something of the old stern look coming across his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most unequivocally and decidedly,&rdquo; was the concise reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been more courteous, and therefore more in accordance with
      General Grant&rsquo;s usual conduct towards those whom he considers beneath him
      in the social scale, to inquire whether any, and if so, <i>what</i>
      amelioration might have taken place in my future prospects to have induced
      me to hazard so bold a step ere my proposal was thus unmistakably
      declined,&rdquo; observed Lewis in a marked yet respectful tone of displeasure;
      &ldquo;it will, however, make no difference in my intentions, as when I shall
      have obtained your answers to a few important questions, and explained to
      you my object in making them, it is possible you may view my conduct in a
      different light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General, who grew taller and stiffer every moment, merely acknowledged
      this speech by an inclination of the head, so slight as to be scarcely
      perceptible; and Lewis continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The late Sir Hugh Desborough, Walter&rsquo;s grandfather, was, I believe, your
      intimate friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, yes, sir; we served together in India, were for six years
      in the same regiment, and lived as if we had been brothers. Why do you ask
      such extraordinary questions?&rdquo; exclaimed the General, startled completely
      out of his dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, in that case, you are probably well acquainted with the
      circumstances of his family history, and can set me right if I state them
      incorrectly,&rdquo; replied Lewis, upon whom the mantle of the General&rsquo;s
      cast-off dignity appeared suddenly to have fallen. &ldquo;Sir Hugh had two sons,
      I believe; the elder married imprudently, quarrelled with his father, who
      refused to receive the lady he had espoused, and severing all family ties,
      lived abroad under a feigned name, and was believed to have died without
      issue. The second son was Walter&rsquo;s father, and Walter inherits the
      baronetcy in default of male issue of the elder son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and the General observed, &ldquo;You are correct in your facts, sir,
      but to what does all this lead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will be better able to perceive, sir, when I inform you that I
      am prepared to prove, indisputably, and to your full satisfaction, the
      following additional particulars. Sir Hugh&rsquo;s eldest son, Captain
      Desborough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right; he was captain in the &mdash;&mdash;th Lancers, and threw up his
      commission when he chose to live abroad. It was said he entered the
      Austrian army, and attained the same rank in that service,&rdquo; interrupted
      the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did so,&rdquo; resumed Lewis, who spoke in the same calm, unimpassioned
      voice which he had used throughout the interview, though to any one who
      knew him well it would have been perceivable that he did so by the
      greatest effort; &ldquo;but those who believed that he died abroad, and without
      male issue, were misinformed: he died in England, in the spring of 18&mdash;&mdash;,
      and left (besides a daughter) one son, who is still living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left a son! why he would be heir to the title and estates instead of
      Walter. Where is he, sir? who is he?&rdquo; exclaimed the General impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis rose, drew himself up to his full height, advanced slowly till he
      stood face to face with the General, and then, fixing his piercing glance
      upon him, said, &ldquo;He now stands before you, General Grant, and asks you
      whether, when he has established his rights before the eyes of the world,
      you will again refuse him your daughter&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reader, the only little bit of mystery in our story (if indeed it has
      presented any mystery at all to your acuteness) is now cleared up; and the
      interest ended, the sooner the tale itself arrives at a conclusion the
      better. But for the satisfaction of the unimaginative, the strong-minded
      women and practical men of the world, who cannot rest assured that two and
      two make four till they have counted it on their fingers, we will write a
      few more last words, winding up the various threads of this veracious
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his interview with General Grant, Lewis had only stated that which he
      was fully prepared to prove; and when the lawyer and his blue bag (not
      that lawyers ever do carry blue bags anywhere but in farces at the minor
      theatres, or those still more &ldquo;unreal mockeries,&rdquo; the pages of modern
      novels) were called in to assist at the conference, the following facts
      were elicited:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The packet of letters which Lewis found amongst Hardy&rsquo;s papers, and which
      gave him the first intimation that he, and not poor Walter, was heir to
      the title and estates of Desborough, had been written by Captain Arundel,
      or, as his name really was, Desborough, to his younger brother, Walter
      Desborough (the father of the poor idiot, who was in fact first cousin to
      Lewis); the object with which these letters were written being to bring
      about a reconciliation between Sir Hugh and his eldest son&mdash;Walter
      Desborough having undertaken the office of mediator. In order to do this,
      it was first of all necessary to disabuse Sir Hugh&rsquo;s mind of an idea that
      Captain Desborough&rsquo;s marriage was not valid and that the children were
      illegitimate; for this purpose the wedding certificate was enclosed
      (proving that he had been married in his own name and by a properly
      constituted authority), together with certificates of the baptism of Rose
      and of Lewis. The letters also contained an account of his having taken
      the name of Arundel, and his reasons for so doing; in fact, without going
      into minutiae, the papers afforded complete evidence legally to establish
      the identity of Captain Desborough and Captain Arundel, and to render
      Lewis&rsquo;s claim to the baronetcy indisputable. To account for their having
      been found among Hardy&rsquo;s papers, it must be borne in mind that Walter
      Desborough was the scoundrel who first roused the evil nature in that
      misguided man by eloping with his wife. Hardy, be it remembered, followed
      the guilty pair, and assaulted the betrayer of his honour to such good
      effect as to confine him to his bed for months; his companion in crime
      returned to her father&rsquo;s house, and died shortly after giving birth to the
      unfortunate Miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she returned to her father, she brought with her a writing-case, in
      which were letters she had received from her seducer previous to her
      elopement; in this desk, for convenience of travelling, Walter Desborough
      had placed papers of his own, and amongst others, the letters, etc., which
      he had shortly before received from his brother. Long ere he recovered
      from the effects of Hardy&rsquo;s chastisement he had forgotten where he had
      placed these papers, and Hardy never discovering them (he left his home
      and enlisted as a soldier on his release from the imprisonment the assault
      entailed upon him), the letters were to all intents and purposes lost,
      till by a chapter of accidents they fell into the hands of Lewis. The
      shock which led to Captain Arundel&rsquo;s (or Desborough, as he should rightly
      have been called) sudden death was caused by reading an account of his
      father, Sir Hugh&rsquo;s demise, in the newspaper. The clue Messrs. Jones &amp;
      Levi had gained was from a shopman in the public library in which Captain
      Arundel had been sitting when he first became aware of his father&rsquo;s
      decease, who gathered, from an involuntary exclamation he made at the
      moment, that Sir Hugh Desborough&rsquo;s death was the subject which had so much
      excited him; this shopman had been a clerk of Messrs. Jones &amp; Levi,
      and learning in their employ that knowledge was sometimes money as well as
      power, sold them for a couple of sovereigns the information he had
      acquired, giving at the same time an account of the strange death of
      Captain Arundel; hence their subsequent application to Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence being so clear and full, Lewis had little difficulty in
      establishing his claim, more especially as General Grant, convinced of its
      justice, did not attempt to resist it on Walter&rsquo;s behalf. The poor fellow
      himself could not be made to comprehend his change of fortune; but he did
      comprehend, to his inexpressible delight, that for some reason or other he
      was always to live with his dear Mr. Arundel, who, when months had gone by
      and arrangements made which he neither understood nor heeded, took him to
      a grand house of his own, where Faust was waiting to receive them in a
      great state of boisterous tail-wagging affection; and when Faust, having
      licked them all over, and having made them damp, dusty, and rumpled in the
      excess of his love, had quite done with them and gone back to a large bone
      on the drawing-room rug, and Lewis placing his arm round Walter&rsquo;s neck,
      had whispered to him that he was never to go away any more, and that he
      hoped before very long Annie would come and live with them, Walter felt
      sure he had never known what it was to be quite happy till then, which
      fact he afterwards communicated to Faust in the strictest confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis&rsquo;s assertion in regard to Annie was not based on mere conjecture; for
      General Grant&mdash;albeit he felt that, in the interview we have lately
      recorded between himself and Lewis, he had been decidedly out-generalled&mdash;did
      not again reject his late tutor&rsquo;s proposal for his daughter&rsquo;s hand. On the
      contrary, with the usual self-knowledge of worldly elderly people (that
      is, of those who, nine times out of ten, dictate the actions, and
      influence for weal or woe the future of the young and generous-hearted),
      the moment he became convinced that Lewis was about to inherit a baronetcy
      and an income little short of £10,000 a year, he contrived to persuade
      himself that when his first surprise had been passed, and he had become
      aware how deeply his daughter&rsquo;s happiness was involved, he should
      certainly have allowed her to unite herself with Sir Lewis Desborough
      under his former phase of a precarious portrait-painter. But if we had
      been Sir Lewis, we should have felt heartily glad we had not been forced
      to rely on such a very &ldquo;forlorn hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose, no longer Arundel, did not enjoy the name of Desborough many weeks,
      for although she had particularly desired to be married on the same day as
      Lewis and Annie, she yet yielded the point when Ursa Major, hearing that
      General Grant would not allow his daughter&rsquo;s wedding to take place till a
      year after the death of Lord Bellefield, grew so outrageous that Rose was
      forced to marry him out of the way, in order to prevent him from snapping
      and growling at every one that came near him. But this was Richard Frere&rsquo;s
      last bearish episode; for constant association with Rose softened his
      little asperity of temper, which, having arisen solely from the unloved
      and unloving existence he had been forced by circumstances to lead,
      disappeared in the sunshine of a happy home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ashford did not long survive the loss of his eldest son, and Charley
      Leicester, the portionless younger brother, with &ldquo;a good set of teeth and
      nothing to eat,&rdquo; is now a highly respectable peer of the realm, with a
      rent-roll to be computed by tens of thousands. Happy in the affection of
      his wife and children (for &ldquo;Tarley&rdquo; has already had two successors to
      dispute the chance of being &ldquo;spoiled by papa, only that mamma won&rsquo;t let
      him&rdquo;), Charles, Lord Ashford, has but one trouble in life, though that
      unfortunately appears likely to prove an increasing one&mdash;viz., that
      those confounded fellows, Schneider &amp; Shears, <i>won&rsquo;t</i> make his
      waistcoats to fit him as they used to do, they are all too tight round the
      waist&mdash;and Schneider &amp; Shears bear the blame meekly, having only
      last week discharged an injudicious foreman, who had been rash enough to
      declare that their excellent customer, Lord Ashford, was growing stout.
      For a short time the Countess Portici resided with her brother and
      sister-in-law, Alessandro having obligingly got himself knocked on the
      head in the cause of liberty, the reversion of this popular watchword
      being about the only legacy he bequeathed to his young, interesting, and
      not particularly disconsolate widow, who, having sown her romance,
      replaced the handsome Italian by a rich old French nobleman, Le Marquis de
      Carosse-Tranquille, irreverently translated by Bracy, who is still a
      bachelor and makes more puns than ever, into &ldquo;My Lord Slow Coach&rdquo;&mdash;a
      title which the mental incapacities of that venerable foreigner rendered
      unpleasantly appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mighty Marmaduke de Grandeville purchased with his wife&rsquo;s money a
      large estate in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shire, which had belonged to
      his family some five hundred years before; he has since instituted a set
      of regulations for his tenantry, formed on the model of the feudal system,
      and if he be not prematurely suffocated by his own greatness, bids fair to
      &ldquo;add a new lustre to the noble name which&mdash;ar&mdash;ahem!&rdquo; etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arundel carried out her design of marrying her &ldquo;blighted barrister,&rdquo;
       and by her liveliness of disposition has done more towards removing the
      mildew from his mind than could have been expected. As, however, in
      accordance with her taste, they live chiefly abroad, Lewis and Annie see
      but little of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Livingstone, as she increased in years, grew harsher, stififer, and
      more frozen than ever, until one bitter winter&rsquo;s day, happening to catch a
      slight additional cold, her temperature sank below the point at which
      animal life could be maintained, and becoming rather stififer and colder
      than usual, the first half of her patronymic ceased to be any longer
      appropriate&mdash;her last word was a cross one.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Grant lived to a good old age, improving, under the influence of
      certain bright-eyed little Desboroughs, into a very amiable grandpapa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fate of Miles Hardy still remains a mystery; that he did not die of
      the wounds received in the death-struggle with Lord Bellefield was
      ascertained; but whether he perished in the Italian revolution, in which
      he was known to take an active part, or, as was rumoured, escaped in
      safety to America, the few who are interested in him have failed to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie and Lewis, after their stormy transit along that portion of the <i>RAILROAD
      OF LIFE</i> in which we have accompanied them, were at length happily
      united; their future fortunes yet lie hid amid the uncut leaves of the
      great book of Fate; but one thing we may safely predict&mdash;viz., that
      whatever trials may be in store for them, they will find in their mutual
      affection a source of constant joy and consolation, of which the
      lonely-hearted are unhappily ignorant.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
